## Services Overview

Databender offers four core services. Start where it hurts most, or combine them.

### Get Clarity (Data & AI Strategy)
Your ERP says one thing, your CRM says another. We connect the systems, clean the records, and give you one version of the truth before you spend on AI.

**Capabilities:**
- Data Foundation: One place for all your data, built to last
- Data Integration: Connect ERP, CRM, PM tools, billing, and field apps into one view
- AI-Powered Data Cleanup: Fix duplicates at 125x less cost than manual review
- AI Readiness Assessment: Know what's realistic before you invest
- AI Roadmapping: Prioritize by ROI and feasibility with quarterly milestones
- AI Governance & Compliance: HIPAA, SOC 2, audit trails, and explainability from day one

### See What's Happening (Analytics & BI)
The report that takes a week to compile is already wrong by the time it's done. We replace the compile-and-present cycle with live answers.

**Capabilities:**
- Executive Dashboards: WIP reports, investor reports, and margin analysis, live
- Agentic Research: AI agents that gather and synthesize information overnight
- Operational Visibility: Job profitability, order status, per-location performance in real time
- Predictive Analytics: Demand forecasting, dead stock flagging, churn predictions
- Managed Data Pipelines: Automated data flows that keep analytics fresh
- Custom Analytical Applications: Profitability calculators, lease trackers, scoring tools

### Put AI to Work (AI & Automation)
Most AI adds work. We build AI that removes steps entirely. Your team makes the judgment calls. The AI does the digging.

**Capabilities:**
- Natural Language BI: Ask questions in plain English, get accurate answers
- AI Agents & Automation: Autonomous agents for research, data processing, workflows
- Document Intelligence: AI reads contracts, invoices, medical records, extracts data, cites sources
- RAG & Knowledge Systems: Decades of documents searchable in seconds with sourced answers
- Conversational AI: Internal assistants and customer-facing chatbots powered by your data
- Local LLM Integrations: AI that stays on your servers for privacy-sensitive industries
- Staff AI Augmentation: Remove the tedious steps, keep the judgment calls

### Build What You Need (Custom Software)
The economics of custom software changed. Purpose-built applications delivered in weeks at a fraction of the old cost. You own every line of code.

**Capabilities:**
- Custom Applications: Replace tab-switching across systems with a single purpose-built view
- System Integration: Connect ERP, CRM, PM tools, and accounting automatically
- Process Automation: Remove manual steps entirely, not add tools on top
- Compliance-Ready Solutions: HIPAA, SOC 2, on-premise builds where data never leaves your control
- Legacy System Modernization: Replace piece by piece, no downtime
- SaaS Replacement: Own the 10% of features you actually use, outright

## Key Differentiators

1. **Removes Work, Doesn't Add It**: Most AI tools add a verification step. We build systems that remove steps entirely. The AI does the digging, your team makes the decisions.
2. **Weeks to ROI**: Working software in your hands in 2-4 weeks. Not a roadmap. Not a prototype.
3. **Own It Outright**: Your code. Your data. No per-seat fees, no annual renewals, no vendor lock-in.
4. **Regulated-Ready**: HIPAA, SOC 2, client confidentiality built in from day one. On-premise when needed.
5. **Founder-Led**: You work directly with senior practitioners, not junior consultants following scripts.
