# Databender Content Style Guide

*Avoiding AI-generated giveaways across all marketing content.*

*Last updated: 2026-01-11*

## Purpose

This guide ensures all Databender content (website, blog, LinkedIn, proposals, emails) reads as authentically human. AI-assisted drafting is fine. AI-sounding output is not.

The goal: content that passes both AI detectors and (more importantly) the human "smell test."

## Voice Principles

### Company Voice

- Professional but with personality
- Direct and confident, not hedging
- Skeptical of hype, grounded in reality
- Punchy over polished
- Specific over generic

### What Makes Us Sound Like Us

- "We're skeptics by nature"
- Strong opinions stated plainly
- Memorable metaphors ("buying lottery tickets," "data problem wearing a sales costume")
- Concrete examples over abstract claims
- Humor where it fits (dry, not forced)

---

## Hard Rules

### Never Use

| Pattern                                         | Why                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| First-person singular ("I", "I've", "my", "me") | Company voice only. Use "we" instead.         |
| Em dashes (-)                                   | AI tell. Use periods, commas, or parentheses. |
| Double hyphens (--)                             | Same rule.                                    |

### AI Slop Words (Ban List)

These words scream "AI wrote this":

**Buzzwords:**
delve, leverage, synergy, robust, seamless, holistic, scalable, actionable, impactful, transformative, paradigm, empower, innovative, game-changer, cutting-edge, next-generation, unlock, optimize

**Vague Formal Terms:**
framework, ecosystem, utilize (use "use"), facilitate, comprehensive, dynamic, stakeholders, deliverables

**Corporate Speak:**
circle back, move the needle, low-hanging fruit, touch base, synergize

### Filler Phrases (Delete on Sight)

- "It's important to note that..."
- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "This begs the question..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "It is worth noting that..."
- "There are many ways to..."
- "One could argue that..."

## AI Detection Patterns to Avoid

AI text gets flagged for being too predictable and uniform. Avoid these patterns:

### Overused Transitions

**Problem:** AI connects every sentence with formal transitions.

**Avoid:** furthermore, however, in addition, as a result, moreover, consequently, therefore, thus, hence

**Fix:** Let sentences stand alone. Implicit connections are fine. Use transitions sparingly.

**Before:** "The data was incomplete. As a result, the model performed poorly. Furthermore, the team lacked context."

**After:** "The data was incomplete. The model performed poorly. The team lacked context."

### Cliche Openings

**Problem:** AI uses generic, templated introductions.

**Avoid:**

- "In the dynamic world of [topic]..."
- "When it comes to [topic]..."
- "In today's fast-paced environment..."

**Fix:** Start with a specific hook, stat, or provocative statement.

**Before:** "In today's competitive business landscape, data is more important than ever."

**After:** "Eighty-seven percent of AI projects never make it to production."

### Formulaic Closings

**Problem:** AI wraps up too neatly.

**Avoid:**

- "In summary,"
- "In conclusion,"
- "To summarize,"
- "Overall," as a paragraph starter

**Fix:** End with a punch, a call to action, or a memorable line. Don't announce the ending.

### Hedging Language

**Problem:** AI is too polite and non-committal.

**Avoid:**

- "It's understandable that..."
- "Ultimately,..."
- "To be sure,..."
- "It could be argued that..."
- "In many cases,..."

**Fix:** State opinions directly. Take a stance.

**Before:** "It could be argued that most companies aren't ready for AI."

**After:** "Most companies aren't ready for AI."

### Redundancy Phrases

**Problem:** AI restates the same idea multiple ways to fill space.

**Avoid:**

- "In other words,..."
- "This means that..."
- "Put simply,..."
- "What this essentially means is..."

**Fix:** State the point once, clearly. Trust the reader.

**Before:** "Regular exercise improves mental health. This means people who exercise feel better emotionally. In other words, physical activity reduces stress."

**After:** "Regular exercise improves mental health, especially by reducing everyday stress."

### Negative Parallelism

**Problem:** AI overuses balanced contrasts that sound insightful but aren't.

**Avoid overusing:**

- "It's not just X, it's Y"
- "Not only A but also B"
- "It's not about X, it's about Y"

**Fix:** Use sparingly. One per piece max. Otherwise, just make the point directly.

### Structural Uniformity

**Problem:** AI creates symmetrical, templated content.

**Signs:**

- Every paragraph same length
- Every section covers exactly 3 points
- Every bullet point same structure
- Perfectly balanced sections

**Fix:** Vary deliberately. Linger on important ideas, rush through obvious ones. Some paragraphs long, some short. Some sections deep, some brief.

### Sentence Pattern Repetition

**Problem:** AI uses the same sentence structure repeatedly.

**Signs:**

- Multiple sentences starting with "This [verb]..."
- Same clause patterns back-to-back
- Every sentence similar length

**Fix:** Mix short punchy sentences with longer complex ones. Vary your openings.

### Tone Flatness

**Problem:** AI maintains one register throughout (usually polite, neutral).

**Signs:**

- No emotional variation
- Constant formality
- No emphasis or opinion

**Fix:** Let tone shift naturally. Show excitement about wins. Show skepticism about hype. Use emphasis.

## Humanization Techniques

Apply these to make content feel authentic:

### Vary Rhythm

- Mix sentence lengths deliberately
- Short sentence. Then a longer one with more complexity and a clause or two.
- Fragment for emphasis.
- Break the "smooth" AI cadence

### Add Texture

- Concrete examples over abstract statements
- Specific numbers ("34% increase" not "significant improvement")
- Mini-anecdotes or scenarios
- Colloquial phrases where appropriate ("sweaty palms and all")

### Show Opinion

- Take a stance, don't hedge everything
- Use emphatic language ("frankly," "surprisingly," "the uncomfortable truth")
- Rhetorical questions ("Do you know which leads will close?")
- Mild skepticism where it fits

### Break Symmetry

- Some paragraphs longer than others
- Some points explored deeply, others briefly
- Don't give equal weight to everything
- "Humans linger on ideas they care about and rush through obvious ones"

### Natural Imperfections

- Start occasional sentences with "And" or "But"
- Use contractions ("don't" not "do not")
- Rhetorical questions
- Direct address to reader ("you," "your")

## First-Person Alternatives

When tempted to use "I," try these instead:

| Instead of...             | Use...                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "I think..."              | State directly, or "You might be thinking..." |
| "I've seen..."            | "We've seen..."                               |
| "Let me explain..."       | "Let's look at..." or just explain            |
| "I believe..."            | State as opinion directly                     |
| "What drives me crazy..." | "Here's what's maddening..."                  |
| "I'm supposed to..."      | "People expect..."                            |

## Quick Checklist

Before publishing any content, verify:

- [ ] No first-person singular (I, I've, my, me)
- [ ] No em dashes or double hyphens
- [ ] No AI slop words (delve, leverage, synergy, etc.)
- [ ] No filler phrases
- [ ] Varied sentence and paragraph lengths
- [ ] At least one concrete example or specific detail
- [ ] Tone shifts naturally (not monotone throughout)
- [ ] Opening hooks, doesn't use cliche intro
- [ ] Closing punches, doesn't use "In conclusion"

## Examples

### Before (AI-sounding)

"In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, it's important to note that data has become a critical asset. Furthermore, organizations that leverage their data effectively can achieve transformative results. As a result, many companies are exploring AI solutions. However, it's understandable that some may feel hesitant about this transition."

### After (Human)

"Most companies are sitting on years of data they've never looked at. The ones who figure out how to use it pull ahead. The ones who don't keep wondering why their competitors seem to know things they don't."

---

## Validation

For important content, run Claude validation:

"Scan this content for AI tells: first-person (I, my, me), em dashes, AI slop words (delve, leverage, synergy, etc.), overused transitions, hedging language, redundancy phrases, structural uniformity, and filler phrases. Flag any violations."
