## Standard Pitches

### 10-Second Pitch (One Sentence)

> "I run a data consulting firm that helps small and mid-sized businesses get enterprise-quality data, analytics, and AI solutions without needing to hire a full internal team."

**Alternate versions:**

> "We're a data consultancy that brings big-company analytics and AI capabilities to businesses that don't have their own data teams."

> "Databender helps SMBs harness their data for better decisions, automation, and AI - we're the data team you don't have to hire full-time."

---

### 30-Second Pitch (Networking Events)

> "I'm Grant, founder of Databender Consulting. We help small and mid-sized businesses that have data problems but no data team to solve them.
>
> That might mean building data pipelines so everything talks to each other, creating dashboards that actually answer the questions you're asking, automating manual processes that eat up your team's time, or implementing AI solutions like predictive analytics.
>
> We work across a lot of industries - healthcare, legal, manufacturing, and more - which actually helps because we bring ideas from one industry that work great in another."

---

### 2-Minute Pitch (When They Want Details)

> "Databender Consulting is a data and AI consultancy I founded to solve a problem I kept seeing: small and mid-sized businesses have the same data challenges as large enterprises, but they can't justify hiring a full analytics team or a data engineering department.
>
> So we come in and do that work for them. That covers a pretty wide range - data pipelines to get information flowing from different systems into one place, analytics dashboards so leadership can actually see what's happening in the business, automation to eliminate the tedious manual work that shouldn't require a person, and AI solutions for things like prediction, classification, or our specialty: agentic data quality at scale.
>
> What makes us different is our versatility. We've worked with healthcare organizations, law firms, manufacturers, fitness studios, oil and gas companies, property managers, university researchers, even gaming operations. That sounds scattered, but it's actually a strength - we bring patterns and solutions from one industry that work brilliantly in another, and we're not locked into one way of thinking.
>
> We're also founder-led, which means you get senior-level attention from day one. You're not handed off to junior consultants working from a playbook.
>
> Most of our work starts with a specific problem - a client knows they need better reporting, or they're drowning in manual data entry, or they want to predict something. We figure out what they actually need, build it right-sized for their business, and train them to use it. No endless consulting engagements, no enterprise-scale complexity they'll never use."

## Pitches by Audience

### For Technical Buyers (IT Directors, Technical Leads)

> "Databender handles the data engineering and analytics work that falls outside your core application focus. We build data pipelines, ETL processes, analytics infrastructure, and ML implementations.
>
> We work across the modern data stack - cloud warehouses, orchestration tools, BI platforms, Python and SQL for the heavy lifting. We can integrate with your existing architecture or help you modernize it.
>
> What's different about us is we're not just implementing what you spec out - we bring architectural thinking and help you avoid the pitfalls we've seen across dozens of implementations. We also have novel capabilities around AI-powered data quality that go beyond traditional validation rules."

---

### For Business Executives (CEOs, CFOs, COOs)

> "Your competitors with bigger budgets have data teams that give them insights, automation, and AI capabilities. We give you access to those same capabilities without the overhead of building an internal team.
>
> Most of our work directly impacts either decisions or efficiency. On the decisions side, we build analytics systems that show you what's actually happening in your business - not just historical reports, but real-time visibility and predictive insights. On the efficiency side, we automate the manual, repetitive processes that eat up your people's time and introduce errors.
>
> We work across industries, which means we bring best practices from wherever they exist. And we size our solutions appropriately - you get what you need without enterprise-scale complexity or pricing."

---

### For Small Business Owners

> "You know you have data that could be useful, but right now it's probably scattered across different systems, maybe some spreadsheets, your accounting software, your CRM - and making sense of it all takes more time than you have.
>
> That's exactly what we help with. We connect your data so it's in one place, build simple dashboards so you can see what matters, and automate the manual stuff that shouldn't need a person clicking around.
>
> We work with businesses across a lot of different industries - from law firms to fitness studios to manufacturers - so we've seen what works. And we build solutions sized for your business, not enterprise software that costs a fortune and takes a year to implement."

---

## Pitches by Industry Context

### Healthcare-Focused

> "Healthcare organizations deal with some of the most complex data challenges - EHR systems, billing data, patient outcomes, regulatory requirements, and often none of it talks to each other.
>
> Databender helps healthcare organizations get their data working together. That might mean connecting clinical and operational data for better visibility, building analytics for quality measures and outcomes tracking, automating reporting workflows, or implementing AI for things like risk prediction.
>
> We understand HIPAA considerations and the specific challenges of healthcare data. And we've worked with healthcare clients from small practices to larger organizations, so we know how to right-size solutions for your situation."

---

### Legal-Focused

> "Law firms and legal departments generate enormous amounts of data - matter information, time and billing, document repositories, client records - but most firms are barely scratching the surface of what they could do with it.
>
> We help legal organizations get value from that data. Common projects include connecting your practice management system with billing and finance for better visibility, automating matter intake and conflicts checking workflows, building analytics for partner compensation or client profitability, or implementing AI for document analysis and classification.
>
> Legal is one of our focus industries, so we understand the specific needs around confidentiality, matter-centric organization, and the business model of legal services."

---

### Manufacturing-Focused

> "Manufacturers are sitting on operational data that could drive real improvements - production metrics, quality data, supply chain information, maintenance records - but it's usually trapped in separate systems and hard to act on.
>
> We help manufacturing companies unlock that data. That includes connecting your ERP, MES, and quality systems for unified visibility, building operational dashboards for production efficiency and quality metrics, automating reporting and alerts, and implementing predictive analytics for maintenance or demand forecasting.
>
> We've worked with manufacturers across different sectors and sizes, so we know how to approach this practically rather than with a massive, multi-year digital transformation that never quite delivers."

---

### General / Capability-Focused

> "We're a data consultancy that works across industries - healthcare, legal, manufacturing, and plenty of others. What stays consistent is the type of work we do: helping businesses get their data organized, visible, and working for them.
>
> That might mean building the infrastructure to get data flowing between systems, creating analytics and dashboards for better decision-making, automating manual processes that waste people's time, or implementing AI and machine learning for prediction, classification, or intelligent automation.
>
> We're founder-led, which means you get senior attention rather than being handed to junior consultants. And we size our solutions for your business - no unnecessary complexity."

## Tips for Delivery

1. **Listen first** - Before pitching, understand what they care about. Adjust emphasis accordingly.

2. **Ask a question** - After any pitch, transition to "What's your biggest data challenge right now?" or "What made you curious about this?"

3. **Use specific examples when possible** - "We just helped a manufacturing company cut their manual reporting time by 80%" is more compelling than general claims.

4. **Don't oversell** - If something isn't a fit, say so. Credibility matters more than any single opportunity.

5. **Match their language** - If they say "BI," use that. If they say "dashboards," use that. Don't correct their terminology.
