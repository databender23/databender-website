1. **LinkedIn** (2-3x/week) - Build awareness, credibility, and engagement
2. **Website** (1-2x/month) - SEO, depth, case studies as proof points

Content types:
- **Industry-specific** (manufacturing data challenges, use cases)
- **Generic** (data infrastructure, analytics, AI/automation topics that apply cross-industry)
