# Manufacturing Sales Staffing Requirements

## Role: Fractional Appointment Setter / SDR

### Purpose

Generate qualified meetings with manufacturing prospects through cold outreach. Once meetings are booked, founder handles the sales conversation and closing.

### Target Output

| Metric | Starting Target | Growth Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Meetings booked/month | 5 | 10 |
| Qualified meetings | 80%+ | 80%+ |

**Definition of "qualified meeting":**
- Decision-maker or strong influencer (CEO, CFO, COO, VP Ops, VP Sales)
- Company fits target profile (see below)
- Genuine interest in discussing data challenges (not just taking a meeting to be polite)

## Target Prospect Profile

### Company Characteristics

Target by **symptoms**, not demographics:

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Multiple disconnected systems | Core pain point we solve |
| No data warehouse | Opportunity for foundation build |
| Recent executive hire (CFO, COO, VP Ops) | New leader = mandate for change |
| Post-acquisition (PE or strategic) | Pressure to professionalize reporting |
| Growth recognition (Inc 5000, regional lists) | Systems straining under growth |
| Recent ERP or CRM implementation | Need to connect new system to everything else |
| Job posting for data/analytics role | Indicates recognized need |

### Company Filters

| Attribute | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Revenue | $10M - $100M | Flexible—symptoms matter more than size |
| Industry | Manufacturing (any segment) | Industrial, automotive, electronics, medical device, aerospace, chemical |
| Geography | National (remote delivery) | Midwest preferred for in-person if needed |
| Employee count | 50-500 | Proxy for complexity |

### Decision Makers to Target

| Title | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| CEO / President / Owner | High | Especially founder-led companies |
| CFO | High | Owns reporting, financial visibility |
| COO / VP Operations | High | Owns operational data challenges |
| VP Sales | Medium | Pipeline visibility, forecasting |
| IT Director | Medium | Technical influencer, not usually decision-maker |

## Outreach Approach

### Channels

| Channel | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| LinkedIn | Connection requests, direct messages, engagement |
| Email | Follow-up after LinkedIn, trigger-based outreach |
| Phone | Follow-up on warm signals, voicemail with context |

**Multi-channel sequences work best.** Don't rely on a single channel.

### Trigger-Based Outreach (Highest Priority)

Reach out when timing creates relevance:

| Trigger | Outreach Angle |
|---------|----------------|
| PE investment announced | "Post-acquisition reporting pressure—we help bridge the gap" |
| New CFO/COO hired | "New leaders often inherit data messes—we accelerate their impact" |
| Growth list recognition | "Congrats on Inc 5000—growth often outpaces data infrastructure" |
| Recent acquisition | "Post-M&A data integration is painful—we've done it before" |
| Job posting for data role | "While you're hiring, we can get started—your new hire inherits working infrastructure" |

### Cold Outreach (Lower Priority)

For accounts without a specific trigger:

- Lead with a relevant observation about their business
- Ask a question rather than pitching
- Keep messages short (under 100 words for LinkedIn, under 150 for email)
- Reference the symptom-based targeting (e.g., "Companies with Salesforce + QuickBooks + separate inventory systems often struggle with...")

### Outreach Cadence

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | LinkedIn connection request (personalized) |
| 3 | Email if not connected |
| 7 | Phone attempt (leave voicemail referencing prior touches) |
| 10 | LinkedIn message if connected, OR second email |
| 14 | Final phone + voicemail |
| 21+ | Move to nurture track (quarterly touchpoints) |

## Tools Required

| Tool | Purpose | Cost Estimate |
|------|---------|---------------|
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Prospecting, trigger alerts | ~$100/month |
| Email finding tool | Get contact emails (Apollo, Hunter, etc.) | ~$50-100/month |
| CRM | Track outreach, pipeline | Existing or HubSpot free |
| Dialpad / phone system | Call tracking, voicemail drop | ~$25/month |

**Total tool cost:** ~$175-225/month
