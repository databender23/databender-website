# Manufacturing Outreach Strategy

## Target Audience

### Scale-Up Manufacturer Profile

**The Ideal Client - "Scale-Up Manufacturer":**
- **Company Age**: 10-20 years old (proven business model, but systems haven't kept pace with growth)
- **Revenue**: $15M - $75M
- **Ownership**: Any structure—founder-led, PE-backed, family-owned, recently acquired
- **Location**: Midwest preferred (relationship-driven), but remote delivery expands reach nationally
- **Situation:**
  - Data scattered across Salesforce, QuickBooks, inventory systems, scheduling tools, spreadsheets
  - No unified view of the business
  - Considering first data hire but facing 12-month timeline to impact
  - Need insights now, not next year
  - Systems straining under current operations

**Targeting Reality Check:**
- Growth rates for private companies are nearly impossible to verify (Inc 5000 data is 2+ years stale)
- PE-backed manufacturers in the $15-75M range are rarer than assumed—most PE deals target either smaller "platform" acquisitions ($5-15M) or larger add-ons ($75M+)
- **Broaden targeting to "operational complexity" signals** rather than ownership structure:
  - Multiple facilities or multi-state operations
  - 100+ employees
  - Recent ERP migration or mid-migration from legacy systems
  - CFO/VP Operations job changes (new leadership = mandate for clean data)
- Don't over-filter: a $20M stable manufacturer with messy data is still a good prospect

**Industry Segments (within manufacturing):**
- Industrial equipment/machinery
- Automotive/transportation suppliers
- Electronics/components
- Medical devices
- Aerospace suppliers
- Chemical/process manufacturing

### Primary Decision Makers

| Title | Why They Care | Messaging Angle |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| CEO/Owner (founder-led) | Business intelligence, operational visibility, growth challenges | "See your whole business in one place for the first time" |
| VP of Operations | Cross-system visibility, efficiency, scaling operations | "Connect your operational data to drive better decisions" |
| VP of Sales | Pipeline visibility, forecasting, sales-finance alignment | "Finally get sales and finance speaking the same language" |
| CFO | Financial visibility, reporting accuracy, due diligence readiness | "Unified data that makes reporting and planning possible" |
| PE Operating Partner | Portfolio company performance, value creation | "Accelerate data infrastructure without the 12-month internal hire timeline" |

### Secondary Influencers
- IT Director/Manager (technical implementation, security)
- Controller (financial data accuracy)
- Business Intelligence/Analytics lead (if exists)
- CRM Administrator (Salesforce integration)

## Account-Based Prospecting Approach

### Target Account Selection: Quality Over Quantity

**This is a long-game relationship channel, not a 12-month revenue fix.** Accept that ABM for this audience takes 2-3 years to mature. Supplement with faster-feedback channels (events, inbound content, proactive audits).

### Two-Tier Account Strategy

**Tier 1: Deep Relationships (50-75 accounts)**
- Work these accounts intensively: monthly touchpoints, multiple stakeholders, real relationship building
- Know each company's situation, key players, recent news
- Treat these like named accounts in enterprise sales

**Tier 2: Broader Awareness (150-200 accounts)**
- Lighter-touch nurturing: quarterly content, trigger-based outreach
- Graduate to Tier 1 when signals emerge (job changes, funding, growth news)
- Accept that most won't convert—this is building long-term awareness

**Why this beats 200-300 accounts worked lightly:**
- Fewer accounts worked deeply outperform many accounts worked superficially
- Manufacturing execs value relationships over volume—they can tell when you know their business
- List exhaustion is real: if 170 accounts don't respond, you need a refresh strategy

**Multi-threading is essential:** Don't just reach one person per account. Simultaneously engage CEO, CFO, and Ops leaders to increase hit rate. One path may open while another stays cold.

### Prospecting Sources

**PE Portfolio Mining:**
1. Identify PE firms active in Midwest manufacturing:
   - Search Crunchbase, PitchBook for manufacturing-focused PE
   - Look at recent platform investments in your geographic area
   - Map portfolio companies to your ideal profile
2. Portfolio companies often share similar data challenges
3. One successful engagement can lead to multiple introductions

**Growth Company Lists:**
- Inc. 5000 Manufacturing companies (filter by Midwest, revenue range)
- Crain's Fast 50 (and regional equivalents)
- Business journals' "Fastest Growing Companies" lists
- Manufacturing industry "40 Under 40" / emerging leaders

**Local Business Resources:**
- Regional manufacturing associations member lists
- Chamber of Commerce manufacturing members
- State economic development manufacturing databases
- Manufacturing extension partnership (MEP) networks

**Competitor & Adjacency Mapping:**
- If you win one manufacturer, identify their competitors and suppliers
- Similar companies likely have similar data challenges

## Outreach Channels

### Channel Priority Order

Manufacturing executives—especially founder-led, Midwest—are often not LinkedIn-active. This audience skews older, less digital, and relationship-driven in person. **However, COVID changed behaviors significantly—test assumptions before committing.**

**Recommended priority (test and adjust):**

1. **Local Events & Proactive Audits** (fastest feedback, highest quality)
2. **Trusted Advisor Referrals** (high conversion but slow to build)
3. **Multi-Channel Outreach** (LinkedIn + email + phone together, not separately)
4. **Content & Inbound** (SEO, events-as-content, video prospecting)

**Critical: Run a 4-week channel test before committing.** Track response rates across LinkedIn, email, and phone for 50 accounts each. Let data decide channel priority for YOUR specific market.

---

### 1. Local Events & Proactive Audits (Primary Channel)

**Events are often the fastest path to quality conversations with this audience.**

**Manufacturing Data Breakfast (Quarterly)**
- Host a 90-minute morning event in your metro area
- Topic: "What $25M-$75M Manufacturers Get Wrong About Data Infrastructure"
- Cost: ~$200-400 for venue/coffee/food
- Target: 12-15 attendees (quality over quantity)
- Goal: 3-5 serious conversations, 1-2 pipeline opportunities
- Invite target accounts directly + ask referral partners to co-invite

**Proactive Audit Offer**
- "We're offering free 30-minute Data Infrastructure Audits for Midwest manufacturers over $15M revenue. No pitch—just findings you can act on."
- Limit to 2-4/month (scarcity creates urgency)
- Requires 30-minute prep call to qualify
- Delivers genuine value before asking for anything

**Why events work for this audience:**
- Manufacturing execs value face-to-face relationships
- Events create natural follow-up opportunities
- Co-hosting with referral partners gives them credibility (they benefit too)
- Attendees self-select as interested in the topic

---

### 2. Trusted Advisor Referrals (Long-Term Channel)

**Reality check:** This is the hardest channel to build and takes 1-2 years to generate consistent volume. CPAs and fractional CFOs have existing vendor relationships and no strong incentive to add you.

**Flip the model: Lead with generosity, not asks.**

| Advisor Type | Traditional Approach (Weak) | Flipped Approach (Stronger) |
|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **CPA firms** | "Send me your clients who need data help" | Win a manufacturer, then refer them TO a CPA you want to partner with |
| **Fractional CFOs** | Ask for introductions | Invite them to co-host your Manufacturing Data Breakfast |
| **ERP implementers** | Ask for post-implementation referrals | Bring them into your deals as ERP partners |

**Better targets: Former operators, not current advisors**
- Recently retired manufacturing CFOs/COOs who now consult
- They understand the pain firsthand and aren't protecting existing vendor relationships
- Find them through LinkedIn (former titles) or local executive networks

**Referral Partner Development Timeline:**
- Months 1-6: Give referrals TO partners; invite to co-host events; build relationship
- Months 6-12: Begin receiving occasional referrals
- Year 2+: Predictable referral flow (if you've invested consistently)

**Referral incentives:** $500 gift card for closed deals is meaningful to YOU but not to a partner at a $2M CPA firm. Focus on relationship value (making them look good to their clients) over cash incentives.

---

### 3. Multi-Channel Outreach (LinkedIn + Email + Phone Together)

**Don't choose one channel—use them together.** A coordinated multi-touch approach outperforms any single channel.

**The Coordinated Sequence:**
1. **Day 1:** LinkedIn connection request (personalized, reference trigger)
2. **Day 3:** Email if not connected (reference the LinkedIn request)
3. **Day 7:** Phone call (reference both previous touches)
4. **Day 10:** LinkedIn message if connected OR second email if not
5. **Day 14:** Final phone + voicemail

**Why this works:**
- Multiple touches in different channels build familiarity
- Executives notice consistency ("this person is persistent")
- Different decision-makers prefer different channels—you cover all bases

**Phone approach:**
- Keep it under 60 seconds
- Reference previous touches: "Hi [Name], I sent you a LinkedIn message last week about..."
- Ask a question, don't pitch

**Phone script:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your name] with Databender. I work with manufacturers around your size on connecting their sales, financial, and operations data. I saw [Company] was recently acquired by [PE firm]—congratulations. Companies going through that transition often need to professionalize their reporting pretty quickly. Is that something you're dealing with, or have you already solved it?"

**Email deliverability warning:** Many smaller manufacturers use aggressive spam filters and local IT that blocks unknown senders. If email isn't working, shift weight to LinkedIn and phone.

---

### 4. Video Prospecting (Underutilized)

**Personalized video messages cut through the noise for this audience.**

**Why video works for manufacturing execs:**
- Almost no one does it—instant differentiation
- Shows you're a real person, not a spam bot
- Harder to ignore than text
- Demonstrates the effort you're willing to put in

**Tools:** Vidyard or Loom (both have free tiers)

**Video approach:**
- Keep it under 60 seconds
- Show their website or LinkedIn profile on screen ("I was looking at [Company]...")
- One specific observation about their business
- One question, not a pitch
- "Would a quick call make sense, or is this not a priority right now?"

**When to use:**
- Tier 1 accounts only (takes 3-5 min per video)
- After initial touches haven't gotten response
- For high-value trigger events (PE investment, major hire)

---

### 5. LinkedIn (Part of Multi-Channel, Not Standalone)

**Reality check:** Many manufacturing executives aren't LinkedIn-active. But COVID changed behaviors—more are active than pre-2020. Test before assuming.

**Profile Optimization:**
- Headline: "Data Partner for Growing Manufacturers | Unified Data Infrastructure"
- About: Focus on outcomes (visibility, reporting, decisions) not timelines
- Featured: Case study with specific results; article on manufacturer data challenges

**For active profiles:**
1. Engage authentically with their content (if they're posting)
2. Build familiarity before any outreach
3. Use as part of coordinated multi-channel sequence

**For inactive profiles:**
- Skip the "engagement" strategy—they're not posting
- Go directly to personalized connection request
- Follow up with email/phone

---

### 6. Industry Events & Associations (Attend, Don't Just Host)

Beyond hosting your own events, attend where your buyers already gather.

**Target Events:**
- Regional manufacturing association meetings
- State manufacturing extension partnership (MEP) events
- Midwest business growth conferences (Crain's, regional business journals)
- Salesforce/HubSpot manufacturing user groups

**Engagement Approach:**
- **Attend to build relationships**, not collect leads
- Offer to speak on practical topics:
  - "What PE-Backed Manufacturers Get Right About Data"
  - "Connecting Salesforce, QuickBooks, and Inventory: A Practical Guide"
  - "The 90-Day Data Roadmap for Growing Manufacturers"
- Connect with attendees on LinkedIn post-event with personalized notes
- Follow up with value, not pitches

**Industry Publications:**
- Place articles in Midwest manufacturing publications
- Sponsor relevant industry podcasts/newsletters
- Guest on manufacturing-focused podcasts

**Connection Request (Warm, Personalized):**
> "Hi [Name], I noticed [Company] on the Inc. 5000 list—congrats on the growth. I work with Midwest manufacturers facing similar scaling challenges, particularly around getting visibility across disconnected systems. Would be great to connect."

**Direct Message Templates:**

*Bridge-while-you-hire positioning:*
> "Hi [Name], congrats on [Company]'s growth. I've been working with Midwest manufacturers in similar situations—growing fast, data scattered across Salesforce, QuickBooks, inventory systems, spreadsheets.
>
> Most are wrestling with whether to hire their first data person or find another path to getting unified visibility.
>
> How are you thinking about that challenge at [Company]?"

*Speed-to-value positioning:*
> "Hi [Name], I saw [Company] recently [trigger event]. That kind of growth creates interesting data challenges—suddenly you need visibility across systems that were never meant to talk to each other.
>
> I help manufacturers get that unified view in about 4 weeks, which bridges the gap while they figure out their longer-term data strategy.
>
> Is data infrastructure something that's on your radar right now?"

*PE-backed company outreach:*
> "Hi [Name], I work with PE-backed manufacturers on data infrastructure—connecting Salesforce, QuickBooks, inventory, and operational systems into a unified view.
>
> I know [PE firm] portfolio companies are often under pressure to professionalize reporting quickly. We help bridge the gap in 4 weeks while companies build out their teams.
>
> Is that a challenge you're facing at [Company]?"

### 2. Email Outreach

**When to Use:**
- Following up after LinkedIn connection
- Reaching people not active on LinkedIn
- Post-trigger event outreach
- Referral follow-up

**Subject Lines (Test):**
- "[Company]'s data infrastructure"
- "Quick question about visibility at [Company]"
- "Bridging the gap while you hire"
- "Connecting QuickBooks + Salesforce + inventory"

**Email Template (Trigger-Based - New Hire):**

```
Subject: Congrats on the new hire

Hi [Name],

Saw you just brought on [New Hire Name] as [Title]. Great move for [Company].

One thing I've noticed with growing manufacturers: even with the right hire, it takes 6-12 months for them to understand the business, identify priorities, and deliver results.

We help bridge that gap—connecting Salesforce, QuickBooks, inventory, and scheduling data into a unified view in about 4 weeks. Gives your new hire a running start, and gives you visibility now.

Would that kind of head start be valuable for [Company]?

[Name]
```

**Email Template (PE Portfolio):**

```
Subject: Data infrastructure for [PE Firm] portfolio

Hi [Name],

I work with PE-backed manufacturers on a common challenge: creating unified visibility across disconnected systems—Salesforce, QuickBooks, inventory, scheduling, spreadsheets.

Most portfolio companies need this for board reporting and operational decision-making, but building it internally takes 12+ months.

We get manufacturers to first deliverable in 4 weeks, bridging the gap while they build their team.

Is data infrastructure on [Company]'s priority list right now?

[Name]
```

**Email Template (Growth Recognition):**

```
Subject: Inc. 5000 congrats + a question

Hi [Name],

Congrats on [Company]'s Inc. 5000 recognition. That kind of growth is exciting—and usually means your data infrastructure hasn't kept pace.

I work with Midwest manufacturers in exactly that situation. Systems that worked fine at $10M start breaking at $30M. Salesforce doesn't talk to QuickBooks. Inventory data lives in a spreadsheet.

We help create unified visibility in about 4 weeks—not a 12-month IT project, just practical data infrastructure that grows with you.

Is that a pain you're feeling at [Company], or have you already solved it?

[Name]
```

### 7. PE Firm & Portfolio Company Relationships

**Reality Check:** PE operating partners are extremely difficult to access. They have existing vendor relationships and preferred provider lists. Cold outreach to operating partners rarely works—you're competing against established relationships.

**Timeline expectation:** Building PE relationships takes 2-3 years. Winning 2-3 portfolio companies from the same PE firm is largely luck—PE firms own dozens of companies, and overlap is rare by chance.

---

**Strategy A: Target PE Due Diligence Directly (Faster Path)**

Rather than waiting to win portfolio companies, offer value to PE firms BEFORE they close deals.

**The Pitch:**
> "We do data infrastructure due diligence for PE firms evaluating manufacturing acquisitions. Before you close, we'll tell you what data mess you're buying—integration complexity, hidden technical debt, realistic timeline to unified reporting."

**Why this works:**
- PE firms want risk reduction, not vendor case studies
- Due diligence is a defined, short engagement (~2-4 weeks, $5K-15K)
- Successful DD naturally leads to post-acquisition implementation work
- You're solving THEIR problem (investment risk), not selling your services

**Where to find PE due diligence opportunities:**
- ACG (Association for Corporate Growth) events
- Industry-specific PE conferences
- LinkedIn: search "manufacturing private equity" and engage with their content
- Direct outreach: "I help PE firms understand the data infrastructure reality of manufacturing acquisition targets"

**Content for PE (create before asking for anything):**
- "Red Flags in Manufacturing Data Infrastructure Before Acquisition"
- "The Hidden Costs of Data Debt in Platform Investments"
- "Data Due Diligence Checklist for Manufacturing M&A"
- "100-Day Data Roadmap for Post-Acquisition Integration"

---

**Strategy B: Portfolio Companies First (Original Approach, Longer Timeline)**

If due diligence positioning doesn't gain traction:

1. **Win portfolio companies independently**
   - Target PE portfolio companies directly (the companies, not the PE firm)
   - Use Crunchbase/PitchBook to identify recently acquired manufacturers
   - These companies have immediate pressure to professionalize reporting

2. **Build case studies from portfolio company wins**
   - After 2-3 successful engagements with companies owned by the same PE firm, you have a story
   - "I've worked with three of your portfolio companies on data infrastructure..."

3. **Then approach the PE firm with proof**
   - Now you're not a cold vendor—you're someone who already knows their portfolio
   - Ask for introductions to other portfolio companies, not a "partnership"

**Who to target at PE firms (in order of accessibility):**
1. **Fractional CFOs/Controllers** working for PE portfolios (most accessible, feel the pain daily)
2. **Portfolio company executives** directly (skip the PE firm entirely)
3. **Operating partners** (only after you have proof from their portfolio)

### 6. Referral Partnerships

**High-Value Partners for Scale-Up Manufacturers:**

| Partner Type | What They Get | What We Get |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Fractional CFOs | Help clients get the financial visibility they need | Access to exactly our ICP during financial transformation |
| PE Operating Partners | Resource to accelerate portfolio company performance | Warm introductions to qualified buyers |
| CPA firms (manufacturing focus) | Add value beyond compliance; help clients modernize | Relationship-based referrals |
| Salesforce partners | Post-implementation value; prove CRM ROI | Integration-ready opportunities |
| ERP implementers | Adjacent service; data warehouse alongside ERP | Enterprise relationships |
| Manufacturing consultants | Complement operational advice with data visibility | Trusted advisor introductions |

**Referral Ask:**
> "When you're working with a growing manufacturer and they mention needing better visibility across their systems, or they're struggling to connect financial, sales, and operational data, I'd love an introduction. That's exactly what we solve.
>
> We get them to first deliverable in 4 weeks—fast enough to make you look good.
>
> What kind of opportunities are you looking for? Happy to reciprocate."

---

## Trigger Events (When to Reach Out)

High-intent moments to prioritize outreach:

### Tier 1 Triggers (High Priority)
1. **PE investment announcement** (immediate pressure to professionalize, new resources to spend)
2. **New IT/Data/Analytics hire** (need support, can fast-track with our help—NOT a competitor!)
3. **Growth announcements** (Inc. 5000, Crain's Fast 50, expansion news)
4. **CFO or VP Operations hire** (mandate to improve visibility)
5. **New board member or advisor** (governance pressure)

### Tier 2 Triggers (Good Timing)
6. **Facility expansion or acquisition** (complexity requires better data)
7. **Salesforce/ERP implementation** (need to connect systems)
8. **Sales team expansion** (pipeline visibility becomes critical)
9. **New product launch** (operational complexity)
10. **Regulatory or compliance announcement** (reporting requirements)

**How to Find Triggers:**
- Google Alerts for target companies + PE firms
- LinkedIn job change notifications (especially IT/data hires)
- Crunchbase/PitchBook funding alerts
- Inc. 5000, Crain's Fast 50, regional growth lists
- Local business journals
- PE firm announcements

---

## Outreach Cadence

### Target Account (Account-Based, Not Volume)

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Research company deeply; identify 2-3 stakeholders; follow on LinkedIn |
| 2 | Engage with company content; look for mutual connections |
| 3 | Personalized connection request to primary contact |
| 4 | If accepted: Engage with their content specifically |
| 5 | Value-first message (question about their situation) |
| 6 | If engaged: Offer to share relevant case study or insight |
| 7-8 | If interested: Suggest a conversation |
| Ongoing | Stay engaged; nurture long-term; watch for trigger events |

### Trigger Event Outreach (Higher Urgency)

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Identify trigger; research context |
| 1-2 | Personalized outreach referencing trigger |
| 7 | Follow-up with additional value or angle |
| 14 | Final attempt with direct ask |
| -- | If no response: Add to ongoing account nurture |

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"We just hired someone for this"** | "That's great news—actually perfect timing. It takes 6-12 months for a new hire to understand the business and deliver results. We can bridge that gap, get them a running start with infrastructure already in place, and help them look like a hero in their first 90 days. Want to connect us so we can help them hit the ground running?" |
| **"We're handling it internally"** | "Makes sense. Most manufacturers we work with tried that first. The challenge is it takes 12+ months to hire, onboard, and deliver—and your growth isn't waiting. We can get you to first deliverable in 4 weeks while you figure out the long-term plan. Does speed matter, or is timeline not a constraint?" |
| **"We're waiting until we're bigger"** | "I hear that a lot. The challenge is the mess just gets bigger too. Companies that wait until $50M to fix their data infrastructure wish they'd started at $20M. What would it be worth to have visibility across your systems now instead of 2 years from now?" |
| **"Budget is tight right now"** | "Understood. Let me ask: what's the cost of flying blind? Every month without unified visibility is another month of decisions made on incomplete data. We're not a big enterprise spend—we're a partner engagement designed for companies at your stage. What kind of investment would make sense if the value was clear?" |
| **"We've tried this before and it failed"** | "What happened? [Listen] Usually it's one of two things: either it was scoped too big (enterprise project for a growth company) or there was no accountability for delivery. We're designed for your stage—4 weeks to first deliverable, practical solutions, not IT projects." |
| **"We're not ready"** | "That's fair. When you say 'not ready,' what would need to change? [Listen] Often companies wait for the perfect moment that never comes. What would it mean for [Company] if you had visibility across your systems 6 months from now vs. waiting until it's urgent?" |
| **"Our data is a mess"** | "That's why companies call us. If your data were clean and organized, you'd have done this yourself already. We help manufacturers go from spreadsheets and disconnected systems to unified visibility—the mess is where we start, not a blocker." |

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Primary Competition: "Hire Internally" or "Do Nothing"

Most prospects aren't comparing you to other vendors—they're deciding between hiring someone, doing nothing, or engaging you.

**vs. "Hire Internally":**
> "You could hire a data analyst or data engineer. The reality: 3 months to hire, 3 months to onboard, 6 months to understand your business and deliver. That's 12 months before you see results.
>
> We deliver in 4 weeks. And when you do hire, they inherit working infrastructure instead of starting from scratch."

**When they've already hired:**
> "Perfect. We're not competing with your new hire—we're accelerating them. We can build the foundation they'd spend 6 months creating. They get a running start, look like a hero in their first 90 days, and can focus on higher-value work."

**vs. "Do Nothing" / "We're not ready":**
> "What's the cost of waiting? Every month without unified visibility:
> - Decisions made on incomplete data
> - Surprises in financial reporting
> - Sales and operations out of sync
> - Board meetings based on spreadsheets
>
> The mess doesn't get better—it compounds as you grow."

---

### Actual Competitors You'll Face

Don't ignore real competitors. Here's how to position against them:

**vs. Regional IT Consulting Firms / MSPs:**
> "They're generalists—they'll configure your email, set up your network, and try to figure out data on the side. Data infrastructure is all we do. We're specialists who've solved this problem dozens of times, not generalists learning on your dime."

**vs. Industry-Specific Software Vendors (Manufacturing BI tools):**
> "Those tools lock you into their ecosystem and their limitations. We're tool-agnostic—we work with whatever systems you already have. Salesforce, QuickBooks, any ERP, spreadsheets—we connect them all. You keep flexibility; they want vendor lock-in."

**vs. Freelancers / Upwork contractors:**
> "For a one-off dashboard, a freelancer might work. For integrated data infrastructure that your business depends on? You need accountability, documentation, and someone who'll be there in 6 months when something breaks. We're a partner, not a gig."

**vs. Big Consulting Firms (Accenture, Deloitte):**
> "They're built for Fortune 500 companies. You'd get junior consultants billing senior rates, a 6-month scoping process, and a solution designed for companies 10x your size. We're right-sized for your stage—senior expertise, practical solutions, fast delivery."

**vs. ERP Vendor's Professional Services:**
> "They want to sell you more licenses and modules. We're vendor-agnostic—we'll connect your ERP to everything else without pushing you toward their ecosystem. Our job is to make your existing tools work together, not sell you new ones."

---

### Enterprise Tools (Rare, but if it comes up)

> "Those tools are built for Fortune 500 companies with full IT departments. You'd spend 18 months implementing and need 3 FTEs to run it.
>
> We're right-sized for companies at your stage—sophisticated enough to scale, simple enough to implement fast."

### vs. Internal IT Team (if they have one)

> "Your IT team is busy keeping the lights on—network, security, help desk. Data infrastructure is a specialized skill set. We work alongside your IT team, not against them. They stay focused on what they're good at; we handle the data layer."

---

## Weekly Outreach Routine

**Monday (30 min):**
- Review trigger events from past week (PE announcements, growth lists, new hires)
- Identify highest-priority accounts for the week
- Check for new mutual connections to warm intro

**Tuesday-Thursday (20 min/day):**
- Engage meaningfully with 3-5 target account posts
- Send 2-3 personalized connection requests
- Follow up with 2-3 existing conversations
- Send 1-2 personalized emails

**Friday (20 min):**
- Update account research notes
- Review week's relationship progress
- Plan next week's priority accounts
- Identify referral partner follow-ups

---

## Tracking & Metrics

### Account Progress Metrics (Primary)

| Metric | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Tier 1 accounts engaged | Progress across 50-75 deep-relationship accounts |
| Tier 2 accounts in nurture | Progress across 150-200 awareness accounts |
| Multi-threaded accounts | Accounts with 2+ contacts engaged |
| Tier 2 → Tier 1 promotions | Accounts graduating based on signal strength |
| Relationships deepening | Moving from stranger → connection → conversation |

### Pipeline Metrics

| Metric | Monthly Target | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Discovery calls booked | 4-6 | Realistic for early-stage channel |
| Calls from warm intro/events | 50%+ | Quality indicator |
| Calls → proposals | 50% | |
| Proposals → closed | 40-50% | Be realistic |
| Average deal size | Track | Target $25K+ |
| Time from first touch to call | Track | Expect 3-6 months |

**Honest annual math:** 5 calls/month × 50% to proposal × 45% close = ~13 deals/year. At $30K average, that's ~$400K from manufacturing channel. This is a **2-3 year build**, not a 12-month revenue diversification. Adjust expectations accordingly.

### Channel Effectiveness Metrics

| Channel | Key Metric | Target |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Events (hosted) | Conversations per event | 3-5 |
| Events (hosted) | Pipeline opportunities per event | 1-2 |
| Proactive audits | Audits delivered/month | 2-4 |
| Proactive audits | Audit → discovery call | 50%+ |
| Multi-channel outreach | Response rate (any channel) | 5-10% |
| Video prospecting | Response rate | 15-20% |

### Activity Metrics (Secondary)

| Metric | Weekly Target |
|--------|---------------|
| Tier 1 accounts touched | 15-20 |
| Tier 2 accounts touched | 30-40 |
| Multi-channel sequences initiated | 5-10 |
| Video prospecting messages sent | 3-5 |
| Referral partner touchpoints | 2-3 |
| Event planning activities | Track monthly |

**Note:** Track what's actually generating conversations. If events work better than outreach, shift time accordingly. Let data drive channel investment.
