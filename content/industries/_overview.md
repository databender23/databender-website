## Shared Themes Across Industries

### Why Mid-Market SMBs?

All our target segments share characteristics that make them ideal clients:

1. **Outgrown basic tools** - Excel and manual processes breaking down
2. **Too small for enterprise solutions** - Snowflake/Databricks overkill; Salesforce overpriced
3. **No internal data team** - Can't hire a full analytics/engineering team
4. **PE pressure** - Often backed by PE with reporting and growth expectations
5. **Ready for consolidation** - Systems scattered, need unification

### The Databender Fit

> "Enterprise capability, SMB economics, senior attention."

We bridge the gap between:
- **What they need**: Sophisticated data infrastructure, AI capabilities, operational visibility
- **What enterprise vendors offer**: Overbuilt, overpriced, oversold by juniors
- **What freelancers offer**: Narrow skills, project-based, no strategic perspective
