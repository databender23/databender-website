# Commercial Real Estate Productized Offerings

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition

> **"Unified portfolio intelligence for growing property managers."**
>
> Growing property managers and PE-backed real estate platforms need enterprise-grade data capabilities but can't justify dedicated data teams. Databender provides on-demand expertise in analytics, BI, and AI—helping you gain portfolio visibility without the overhead.

### Why We Fit CRE

We're not generalists learning real estate on your dime. We specialize in:

- **Multi-source data integration** connecting property management systems, accounting platforms, and operational tools
- **Investor-grade reporting** with the polish and accuracy LPs expect
- **Operational analytics** that drive NOI improvement across growing portfolios

This experience is especially relevant for PE-backed platforms acquiring properties with different systems, and growing managers needing institutional-grade visibility.

### What We Really Offer

We're not selling dashboards. We're selling **outcomes**:
- Single source of truth across all properties
- Investor reporting that takes hours, not weeks
- Lease intelligence that captures renewal opportunities
- Portfolio visibility that supports acquisition decisions

The specific services (portfolio analytics, investor reporting, lease intelligence) are means to these ends.

### Why Us vs. Alternatives

| Alternative | What's Missing | Why Databender Wins |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Buy analytics software** (Tableau, Power BI) | Someone to implement, connect property data, maintain | We deliver outcomes, not tools. We implement AND build what you need. |
| **Use property management reports** | Cross-property visibility, custom analytics, investor-grade formatting | PM reports are property-by-property. We unify everything into portfolio intelligence. |
| **Hire internally** | Full-time analyst: $100K+. Engineer: $150K+. | Fractional access to senior expertise. Both roles, on demand, without the overhead. |
| **Enterprise CRE analytics platform** | $100K+/year, designed for REITs, not growing managers | Right-sized for your portfolio. Mid-market appropriate investment, custom to your needs. |
| **DIY in Excel** | Time, accuracy issues, no scalability | We deliver in weeks. Your team should focus on operations, not spreadsheet management. |

### The Bridge Positioning

> "We're not trying to replace your future data team. We're the bridge that gets you there—delivering value now while you scale. When you hire, we'll train them and hand off."

## Service 1: Portfolio Analytics

### The Problem

Most growing property managers know their individual property performance but lack unified visibility across the portfolio. Occupancy rates, NOI, lease expirations, and tenant mix are tracked in separate spreadsheets—if at all. This lack of visibility leads to missed opportunities and reactive decision-making.

This problem is especially acute for:
- **PE-backed platforms** acquiring properties with different PM systems
- **Growing managers** scaling beyond Excel-based tracking
- **Multi-asset portfolios** with mixed retail, office, and industrial properties

### What We Deliver

## Service 2: Investor Reporting

### The Problem

Investor reporting is a quarterly scramble. Data lives in different property management systems. Someone manually pulls reports, consolidates in Excel, formats in PowerPoint, and prays nothing is wrong. What should take a day takes two weeks—and accuracy is never guaranteed.

## Service 3: Lease Intelligence

### The Problem

Lease management is fragmented. Renewal dates live in lease files. Rate data is scattered across property systems. Tenant financials aren't systematically tracked. The result: missed renewal opportunities, reactive negotiation, and below-market rates persisting for years.

## Service 4: Data Foundation

### The Problem

Every property uses different software. Yardi here, AppFolio there, MRI somewhere else. Plus separate accounting, separate banking, separate everything. Getting a simple portfolio-wide report takes days of manual consolidation. Historical data is messy. There's no single source of truth.

- Data Quality: $15,000-30,000 depending on scope and historical depth

### ROI Framework

## Pricing Principles

1. **Value-based, not hourly**: Price reflects business impact, not time spent
2. **Clear scope boundaries**: Defined properties, systems, deliverables upfront
3. **Low entry point**: $5,000-7,500 entry removes friction for first engagement
4. **Modular expansion**: Additional properties/systems as priced add-ons
5. **Retainer incentive**: Annual commitment at 10-15% discount
6. **You own the output**: Unlike SaaS, what we build is yours

## Discovery Questions

To qualify and scope appropriately:

1. "How many properties do you manage, and how many different PM systems are in use?"
2. "When you need a portfolio-wide report, how long does it take and who does it?"
3. "How do you currently handle investor reporting? What's the pain level?"
4. "Do you have visibility into lease expirations across all properties?"
5. "What's your biggest frustration with data across the portfolio?"
6. "Are you acquiring properties? How's the data integration going?"
7. "Do you have anyone internally focused on data and analytics?"
8. "What would success look like in 6 months?"

## Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "This is more than we expected to spend" | "Let's start smaller. The Portfolio Analysis is $5,000—we prove value before you commit to anything larger. If ROI is there, we expand. If not, you've learned something for a modest investment." |
| "We need to think about it" | "Of course. What would help you make the decision? Happy to provide references, a sample deliverable, or a more detailed scope." |
| "Can you do it cheaper?" | "We can reduce scope to fit budget. But I'd rather do something meaningful well than something comprehensive poorly. What's most important to you?" |
| "What if our data is a mess?" | "That's exactly why we offer the Data Foundation services. We can clean up and connect data as a first phase, then build analytics on a solid foundation." |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "We start with clear success criteria. If we're not delivering, we'll adjust approach or scope. We're not in the business of charging for work that doesn't help you." |
