# Scale-Up SMBs: Lead Magnets & Qualification

## Target Market: PE-Backed & Rapidly Scaling SMBs

### Who We're Targeting

**Primary profile:**
- SMBs experiencing rapid growth (20-50%+ annual revenue growth)
- Recently received PE funding or preparing for next funding round
- Headcount increasing rapidly (10+ hires/year)
- $5M-$75M revenue range
- Systems and processes that worked at smaller scale are breaking down

**Common characteristics:**
- Founder/operator still heavily involved but increasingly stretched
- Finance team drowning in manual reporting
- Multiple disconnected systems (CRM, accounting, spreadsheets, legacy tools)
- No dedicated data or IT leadership
- Investor pressure for better reporting and visibility
- New hires struggling to get up to speed

**Industries (secondary to profile):**
- Professional services scaling up
- Distribution and logistics
- Light manufacturing
- Healthcare services (clinics, practices rolling up)
- B2B SaaS approaching growth stage
- Any PE portfolio company in growth mode

---

## The Pain Points We Solve

### 1. Systems Can't Keep Up
> "We've grown 3x in two years and everything is held together with duct tape and spreadsheets."

- Systems that worked for 10 employees break at 50
- Data scattered across tools that don't talk to each other
- Manual workarounds multiply as company grows
- Technical debt accumulates faster than capacity to address it

### 2. Investor Reporting Is a Fire Drill
> "Every board meeting is preceded by a week of scrambling to pull together numbers."

- No single source of truth for KPIs
- Finance team manually consolidating from multiple systems
- Numbers don't always reconcile
- Limited visibility between reporting periods

### 3. New Hires Can't Get Up to Speed
> "We're hiring fast but it takes months before people are productive because nothing is documented and systems are a mess."

- Tribal knowledge in founders' heads
- No centralized documentation or processes
- New employees recreate work that's been done before
- Onboarding is inefficient and frustrating

### 4. No Capacity for Strategic Data Work
> "We know we need better analytics and maybe AI, but we're too busy fighting fires to think about it."

- Leadership wants data-driven decisions but lacks infrastructure
- Competitors using AI while you're stuck in spreadsheets
- No internal expertise to evaluate options or implement solutions

### 5. Sales Data Is a Mess
> "Our CRM is chaos. Reps don't trust the pipeline numbers, and we can't forecast accurately."

- Duplicate contacts, incomplete records, inconsistent data entry
- No lead scoring—reps treat all leads equally
- Pipeline forecasts are gut feel, not data-driven
- Marketing and sales point fingers at each other
- Can't answer basic questions: What's our conversion rate? Which sources work?

## Lead Magnet Strategy: Problem-Focused, Urgency-Driven

Unlike generic "readiness assessments," our lead magnets should:
1. **Quantify the pain** (show them the cost of inaction)
2. **Create urgency** (growth compounds problems)
3. **Position Databender as the solution** (on-demand expertise)

---

## Primary Lead Magnet: "Scale-Up Data Health Check"

### Concept
A focused assessment that helps scaling companies identify whether their data and systems infrastructure can support their growth trajectory—and what breaks if it can't.

### Why It Works
- Speaks directly to growth-stage pain
- Quantifies risk and opportunity cost
- Self-selects for companies with budget (PE-backed, growing)
- Creates urgency around infrastructure gaps

### Assessment Flow

**Step 1: Company Profile**
- Company name
- Your role
- Industry
- Approximate annual revenue
- Employee count now vs. 12 months ago
- Recent funding or ownership change? (PE acquisition, growth round, etc.)

**Step 2: Growth & Systems Stress Test (7 questions)**

1. "How would you rate your current systems' ability to support your growth?"
   - Solid—systems scale well
   - Adequate—occasional friction but manageable
   - Strained—frequent workarounds required
   - Breaking—major bottlenecks limiting growth

2. "How long does it take to produce investor/board reporting?"
   - Hours (largely automated)
   - 1-2 days (some manual work)
   - 3-5 days (significant manual consolidation)
   - A week or more (heroic effort each time)

3. "When you hire someone new, how long until they're fully productive?"
   - 2-4 weeks
   - 1-2 months
   - 3-6 months
   - Varies wildly / we don't really track this

4. "Do you have a single source of truth for key business metrics?"
   - Yes—one system/dashboard everyone uses
   - Mostly—with some exceptions
   - No—different people have different numbers
   - We don't consistently track key metrics

5. "How much time does your team spend on manual data work (copying, consolidating, reformatting)?"
   - Minimal (<5 hours/week across team)
   - Moderate (5-15 hours/week)
   - Significant (15-30 hours/week)
   - Extensive (30+ hours/week)

6. "Do you have dedicated data/IT leadership?"
   - Yes—full-time data or IT leader
   - Partial—someone handles it part-time alongside other duties
   - Outsourced—we use an MSP or consultant
   - No—founder/ops handles it ad hoc

7. "If you have a sales team: How confident are you in your CRM data and pipeline forecasts?"
   - Very confident—data is clean, forecasts are reliable
   - Somewhat confident—mostly accurate with some gaps
   - Not confident—significant data quality issues
   - No confidence—CRM is chaos, forecasts are gut feel
   - N/A—we don't have a sales team or CRM

**Step 3: Contact Capture**
- Work email (required)
- Name (required)
- Title (required)
- Phone (required for this audience—signals seriousness)
- "What's your biggest infrastructure challenge as you scale?" (optional, great qualifier)

**Step 4: Results**

**Scale Readiness Score (0-100)** with breakdown:
- Systems Scalability: XX/20
- Reporting Maturity: XX/20
- Onboarding Efficiency: XX/20
- Data Foundation: XX/20
- Sales Data Health: XX/20 (if applicable)

**Personalized Insights:**

*For low scores:*
> "Your infrastructure is showing significant strain. At your current growth rate, these friction points will compound—each new hire adds complexity, and each reporting cycle gets harder. Companies in your situation often find that investing in infrastructure now prevents much larger costs (and crises) later."

*For medium scores:*
> "You're managing, but there's clear opportunity cost. The hours your team spends on manual reporting and workarounds could be redirected to growth activities. As you continue scaling, these gaps will widen."

*For high scores:*
> "Your foundation is solid. You may benefit from targeted improvements—particularly around [specific gap area]—but you're better positioned than most growth-stage companies."

**CTA:** "Want to discuss what infrastructure investments would have the highest ROI for your growth? Schedule a 30-minute Scale-Up Strategy Call."

## Secondary Lead Magnet: "Investor Reporting Readiness Calculator"

### Concept
A quick tool that calculates how much time and money a company is spending on manual investor reporting—and what automation could save.

### Inputs
- How often do you report to investors? (Monthly/Quarterly)
- How many hours does reporting take each cycle?
- How many people are involved?
- Average hourly cost of those people
- Do reports ever have errors that need correction?

### Outputs
- Annual cost of current reporting process
- Estimated time savings with proper infrastructure (50-70% reduction)
- Annual savings potential
- "Break-even" timeline for infrastructure investment

### Why It Works
- Specific, quantifiable pain point
- PE-backed companies *must* do investor reporting
- Creates urgency with dollar figures
- Natural lead-in to conversation

## Secondary Lead Magnet: "Sales Data Health Check"

### Concept
A focused assessment for B2B scale-ups with sales teams. Evaluates CRM data quality, pipeline reliability, and readiness for lead scoring and revenue analytics.

### Why It Works
- Specific to B2B companies with growing sales teams
- Surfaces CRM pain that sales leaders feel acutely
- Natural lead-in to Sales & Revenue Data Foundation offering
- PE firms care deeply about sales predictability

### Assessment Flow

**Step 1: Sales Team Profile**
- How many sales reps do you have?
- What CRM do you use?
- How long have you been using it?

**Step 2: Data Quality Questions (5 questions)**

1. "How confident are you in your CRM contact/account data?"
   - Very confident—data is clean and current
   - Somewhat confident—some duplicates and gaps
   - Not confident—significant quality issues
   - Very low—CRM is a mess

2. "Do you have a lead scoring system?"
   - Yes, automated and trusted by sales
   - Yes, but not consistently used
   - Informal/manual process
   - No lead scoring

3. "How accurate are your pipeline forecasts?"
   - Very accurate (within 10%)
   - Fairly accurate (within 25%)
   - Often off (within 50%)
   - Unreliable (just guesses)

4. "Can you answer: What's your stage-by-stage conversion rate?"
   - Yes, immediately from a dashboard
   - Yes, but it takes work to calculate
   - Not reliably
   - No idea

5. "How well do sales and marketing share data?"
   - Seamlessly—single system, shared visibility
   - Adequately—some integration, occasional gaps
   - Poorly—different systems, finger-pointing
   - Not at all—completely siloed

**Step 3: Contact Capture**
- Work email (required)
- Name (required)
- Title (required)
- Company (required)
- Phone (required)

**Step 4: Results**

**Sales Data Health Score (0-100)** with breakdown:
- CRM Data Quality: XX/25
- Lead Scoring Maturity: XX/25
- Pipeline Reliability: XX/25
- Sales-Marketing Alignment: XX/25

**Personalized Insights:**

*For low scores:*
> "Your sales data foundation has significant gaps. Reps are likely wasting time on unqualified leads, and your forecasts are probably unreliable. This is costing you deals and making it hard to plan. The good news: this is fixable, and the ROI from clean sales data is typically fast and measurable."

*For medium scores:*
> "You have the basics in place but there's clear room for improvement. With some focused work on data quality and lead scoring, you could significantly improve rep efficiency and forecast accuracy."

**CTA:** "Want to discuss how to turn your CRM from chaos to competitive advantage? Schedule a Sales Data Strategy Call."

   Board meetings shouldn't be preceded by fire drills. We build the infrastructure so reporting is automatic, accurate, and painless.

3. **"Bridge the gap while you build your team."**
   You need data and IT expertise now, but hiring takes time. We provide senior-level capability on demand while you scale—and help you hire right when you're ready.
