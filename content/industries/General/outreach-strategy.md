# Scale-Up SMBs: Outreach Strategy

## Overview

This document covers outreach for PE-backed and rapidly scaling SMBs—companies experiencing growth that's outpacing their infrastructure. The approach targets a specific buyer profile (growth-stage, typically PE-backed, systems under strain) rather than any industry.

---

## The Opportunity

### Why PE-Backed Scale-Ups?

**Budget exists.** PE firms invest in infrastructure. If the portfolio company needs data/IT help, there's usually budget to address it.

**Urgency is built-in.** Growth creates pressure. Investor expectations create deadlines. Problems that can be deferred at stable companies must be solved at growing ones.

**Pain is acute.** Systems that worked at 20 employees break at 80. Reporting that took a day now takes a week. New hires can't get up to speed. These are felt problems.

**Recurring relationship potential.** Scale-ups need ongoing support. Initial project → retainer → referrals to other portfolio companies.

### The Buyer Profile

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $5M-$75M |
| Growth rate | 20-50%+ annually |
| Employee growth | 10+ net new hires/year |
| Ownership | PE-backed, family office, or growth equity |
| Data/IT team | None or part-time/stretched |
| Pain level | Systems visibly straining |

### Common Titles to Target
- CEO / Founder (smaller companies)
- COO / VP Operations
- CFO / VP Finance (especially for reporting pain)
- VP Sales / CRO (for sales data and pipeline pain)
- Director of Operations
- PE Operating Partner (for portfolio-wide opportunities)

## Primary Channels

### 1. PE Operating Partner Network

**The opportunity:** PE firms have multiple portfolio companies, many with similar infrastructure challenges. One relationship can unlock multiple engagements.

**Approach:**

**Identify targets:**
- Lower middle market PE firms ($50M-$500M fund size)
- Growth equity firms investing in SMBs
- Family offices with operating company portfolios
- Search funds post-acquisition

**Build relationships with operating partners:**
- Operating partners are tasked with improving portfolio company operations
- They're always looking for reliable resources to deploy across portfolio
- One strong relationship = access to 5-20 potential clients

**Messaging to operating partners:**
> "I work with portfolio companies on data and IT infrastructure during growth phases—the messy middle where systems are breaking but it's too early for a full-time hire. I've helped companies get investor reporting from a week-long fire drill to a few hours, built infrastructure that actually scales with growth, and bridged the gap until they could hire internally. Happy to be a resource if any of your companies are hitting those walls."

**Outreach cadence:**
- Research firm and portfolio before reaching out
- Personalized LinkedIn connection request
- Follow-up message with specific value proposition
- Offer: "Happy to do a quick infrastructure assessment for any portfolio company—no charge, no obligation. If there's a fit for deeper work, great. If not, they get a useful outside perspective."

### 2. LinkedIn (Targeted Outreach + Selective Content)

**Primary use:** Targeted outreach to decision-makers at scale-up companies, not broad content creation.

**Profile positioning:**
- Headline: "On-Demand Data & IT for Scaling Companies | PE Portfolio Specialist"
- Summary focused on scale-up challenges and "bridge while you build" positioning
- Case examples of growth-stage infrastructure work

**Outreach strategy:**

**Finding targets:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator filters: Company headcount growth, funding events, industry
- Monitor "New Funding" and "Company Growth" alerts
- Search for job postings (companies hiring rapidly = growing)
- Review PE firm portfolio pages for target companies

**Connection request templates:**

*To CEO/Founder:*
> "Hi [Name]—saw [Company] is growing quickly. I help scaling companies build data and IT infrastructure that doesn't break at 2x the headcount. Would be great to connect."

*To CFO:*
> "Hi [Name]—I work with growth-stage companies on the infrastructure side, particularly around investor reporting and data consolidation. Always interested in connecting with finance leaders navigating scale."

*To COO/Operations:*
> "Hi [Name]—I specialize in helping scaling companies build systems that actually keep up with growth. Would be great to connect."

**Follow-up message (after connection):**
> "Thanks for connecting. Quick question: as [Company] scales, where are you feeling the most strain on your systems and data infrastructure? I ask because that's exactly what I help companies solve—curious if it resonates."

**Content (selective, quality over quantity):**

Post when you have something genuinely useful:
- Lessons from a scale-up project (anonymized)
- "The infrastructure mistake I see PE portfolio companies make"
- Contrarian take on data/IT decisions during growth
- Responses to trends affecting scaling companies

**Not:** Generic tips, motivational content, engagement bait

### 3. Upwork (Opportunistic, Declining Priority)

**Role:** Catch inbound from scale-ups searching for help. Not primary channel for this segment.

**Profile optimization:**
- Mention scale-up and growth-stage experience
- Reference PE portfolio company work
- Keywords: "scaling," "growth stage," "investor reporting," "infrastructure"

**Job targeting:**
- Flag jobs from companies showing growth signals
- Prioritize jobs mentioning investor reporting, system consolidation, or scaling challenges
- Avoid: commodity work, unrealistic budgets

**Proposal approach:**
- Lead with growth-stage experience
- Ask about their growth trajectory and infrastructure challenges
- Position as strategic partner, not task executor

### 4. Referrals from Existing Network

**Most reliable channel.** Scale-ups know other scale-ups. PE partners know other PE partners. Past clients in one portfolio company can refer within the portfolio.

**Systematized referral approach:**

**Post-project ask:**
> "This has been a great engagement. As you know, I specialize in helping scaling companies with exactly these kinds of infrastructure challenges. Do you know other founders or operators—maybe in your PE firm's portfolio or your network—who are hitting similar walls? I'd appreciate an introduction."

**PE portfolio referral:**
> "If this approach has been helpful, I'd be happy to do a similar assessment for other companies in [PE firm]'s portfolio. Would you be comfortable introducing me to [operating partner / other portfolio CEO]?"

**Stay-top-of-mind touchpoints:**
- Quarterly check-in with past scale-up clients
- Share relevant insights (not sales pitches)
- Ask how growth is going, surface new pain points

### 5. Accounting & Advisory Firm Partnerships

**The insight:** Accountants and fractional CFOs work with multiple scaling companies. They see the infrastructure pain but can't solve it. Strategic partnership = warm referrals.

**Target partners:**
- CPA firms serving growth-stage companies
- Fractional CFO providers
- Business advisors and consultants serving SMBs
- M&A advisors (pre/post acquisition infrastructure needs)

**Approach:**
> "I specialize in data and IT infrastructure for scaling companies—the systems side that complements what you do on finance and strategy. When your clients are struggling with reporting that takes too long, data that doesn't reconcile, or systems that can't keep up with growth, that's where I can help. Would you be open to a referral relationship?"

**Value exchange:**
- You send them companies that need accounting/CFO help
- They send you companies that need data/IT infrastructure
- Everyone wins, clients get better service

## Outreach Messaging Framework

### The Core Positioning

> "I'm the data and IT team for companies that are growing too fast to hire one but too complex to ignore the problem. I help PE-backed and scaling SMBs build infrastructure that keeps up with growth—without the overhead of full-time hires or the risk of systems that break at scale."

### Key Themes by Pain Point

**Systems strain:**
> "The systems that got you to $10M revenue often can't get you to $30M. I help scaling companies modernize infrastructure before it becomes a crisis—consolidating scattered data, connecting disconnected systems, and building foundations that actually scale."

**Investor reporting:**
> "If board meetings are preceded by a week of data scrambling, something's broken. I help PE portfolio companies build reporting infrastructure that's automated, accurate, and doesn't require heroic effort every quarter."

**Onboarding/knowledge:**
> "When every new hire takes 3+ months to get productive because nothing is documented and systems are tribal knowledge, growth actually slows you down. I help scaling companies build the infrastructure—documentation, systems, processes—that makes new hires productive fast."

**No internal capacity:**
> "You need data and IT expertise, but hiring takes time and you need help now. I bridge the gap—senior capability on demand while you scale—and help you hire right when you're ready."

**Sales data chaos:**
> "Your CRM is a mess. Reps don't trust the pipeline numbers. Forecasts are gut feel. Marketing and sales point fingers. Sound familiar? I help scaling B2B companies build the sales data foundation that turns CRM chaos into a competitive advantage—clean data, lead scoring, pipeline visibility."

### Differentiation: Why Databender vs. Alternatives

| Alternative | Why Databender Is Better |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Big consulting firms | We're right-sized for SMBs. No junior consultants, no bloated scope. Senior expertise at a price that makes sense. |
| Traditional MSPs | We're strategic, not just support. MSPs keep lights on; we build infrastructure for growth. |
| Hiring internally | We're faster. You need help now, not in 6 months. We bridge the gap and help you hire right when ready. |
| DIY / Founder handles it | We give you your time back. Your job is growth strategy, not wrestling with data and systems. |

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're planning to hire someone" | "That's smart—you'll need internal capability eventually. The question is what to do in the meantime. I can bridge the gap, get critical infrastructure in place, and even help you define the role and evaluate candidates. Many clients keep me on for overflow even after they hire." |
| "We're not sure we have budget" | "Let's figure out if there's a real problem first. If infrastructure gaps are costing you time, money, or growth, the ROI usually justifies the investment. If not, I'll tell you—no point solving a problem that doesn't exist." |
| "We've tried consultants before and it didn't work" | "I hear that a lot. Usually it's because the consultant was either too junior, too generic, or didn't understand growth-stage dynamics. I specialize in exactly this phase—I've seen what works and what doesn't. Happy to share references from similar companies." |
| "Can't we just use [software tool]?" | "Maybe. If there's a tool that solves your problem, you should use it—that's the cheapest option. I'm useful when the problem is connecting multiple tools, when you need custom logic, or when implementation requires expertise you don't have internally." |
| "We don't have time to manage a consultant" | "I get it—you're stretched. That's actually why I structure engagements to minimize your involvement. I need input on priorities and access to systems, but I'm not going to create more work for you. The whole point is to give you capacity back." |

**To CFO:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> I work with growth-stage companies on data infrastructure, particularly around investor reporting and financial systems. One pattern I see: reporting that was manageable at $10M becomes a fire drill at $30M.
>
> Is that something [Company] is navigating as you scale?

**To VP Sales / CRO:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> Quick question: how confident are you in your CRM data and pipeline forecasts right now?

### Warm Email (Referral)

```
Subject: [Referrer] suggested I reach out

Hi [Name],

[Referrer] mentioned that [Company] is growing quickly and might be hitting some infrastructure walls—systems that worked at smaller scale starting to strain.

That's exactly what I help with. I work with PE-backed and scaling SMBs as their on-demand data and IT team during the growth phase. I've helped similar companies:
- Get investor reporting from a week-long scramble to a few hours
- Build infrastructure that actually scales with headcount
- Bridge the gap until they could hire internally

Would a quick call be useful to see if there's a fit?

[Name]
```

### PE Operating Partner Outreach

```
Subject: Resource for portfolio company infrastructure

Hi [Name],

I work with PE portfolio companies on data and IT infrastructure during growth phases—the messy middle where systems are breaking but it's too early (or too hard) to hire full-time.

Typical engagements: investor reporting automation, system consolidation, scalable data infrastructure, and bridging the gap until the company can build internal capability.

If any of your portfolio companies are hitting those walls, I'd be happy to do a quick assessment—no charge, no obligation. Sometimes an outside perspective surfaces things that are hard to see from inside.

Worth a conversation?

[Name]
```
