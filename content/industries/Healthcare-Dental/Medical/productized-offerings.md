# Healthcare Productized Offerings

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition

> **"Your data and analytics team—without the department."**
>
> Independent healthcare providers need enterprise-grade data capabilities but can't afford dedicated specialists. Databender provides on-demand expertise in analytics, BI, and AI—helping you compete with hospital systems without the hospital-sized budget.

### Healthcare Credibility

We're not generalists learning healthcare on your dime. We've built production healthcare software:

- **Surgical item tracking systems** used daily in operating rooms to improve usage reporting accuracy and cost visibility
- **HIPAA-compliant data infrastructure** handling sensitive clinical and operational data
- **Clinical workflow integration** — we understand what it takes to get software adopted in high-stakes healthcare environments

This experience is especially relevant for ASCs, where surgical supply costs and per-case margins are core operational concerns.

### What We Really Offer

We're not selling data or dashboards. We're selling **outcomes**:
- Compete effectively with hospital systems
- Make decisions based on data, not gut feel
- Automate soul-crushing administrative work
- Get visibility into what's actually driving your business

The specific services (competitive intelligence, referral analytics, operational optimization, AI automation) are means to these ends.

### Why Us vs. Alternatives

| Alternative | What's Missing | Why Databender Wins |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Buy analytics software** (Tableau, Power BI) | Someone to implement, build dashboards, connect data, maintain | We deliver outcomes, not tools. We can implement the software AND build what you need. |
| **Use EMR reports** | Cross-system visibility, custom analytics, strategic insights | EMR reports are basic. We integrate EMR + billing + scheduling + marketing into unified intelligence. |
| **Hire internally** | Full-time analyst: $100K+. Engineer: $150K+. Data scientist: $180K+. | Fractional access to senior expertise. All three roles, on demand, without the overhead. |
| **Buy healthcare analytics platform** (Health Catalyst, etc.) | $100K+/year, designed for health systems, not independent providers | Right-sized for your practice. SMB-appropriate investment, custom to your needs. |
| **DIY** | Time, expertise, years to get results | We deliver in weeks. Your clinical staff should focus on patients. |

### The Bridge Positioning

> "We're not trying to replace your future data team. We're the bridge that gets you there—delivering value now while you figure out long-term staffing. When you hire, we'll train them and hand off."

## Service 1: Per-Case Profitability (ASC-Specific)

### The Problem

Most ASCs know their total revenue and total costs. Very few know profitability by procedure and payer—or where supply costs are eating margin. This lack of visibility leads to bad decisions: accepting unprofitable cases, underpricing to payers, and missing operational improvement opportunities.

This problem is especially acute for:
- **PE-backed ASC platforms** acquiring facilities with different cost structures
- **Multi-specialty ASCs** with a mix of high-margin and low-margin procedures
- **Orthopedic ASCs** where implant costs vary wildly

### Why We Have Credibility Here

We've built surgical item tracking software used in operating rooms—we understand the data chaos of surgical environments, from preference cards to implant tracking to usage variance. This isn't theoretical for us.

## Service 2: Competitive Intelligence

### The Problem

Independent providers are 30-50% cheaper than hospitals for the same services—but they can't prove it. They lose employer conversations, accept unfair payer rates, and miss marketing opportunities because they lack the data.

## Service 3: Revenue & Referral Analytics

### The Problem

Most providers don't know where their patients actually come from. They can't see which physicians are loyal, which are drifting to hospitals, or which payers are most profitable. Decisions are made on gut feel, not data.

### What We Deliver

- Revenue Analytics Dashboard: $10,000 (basic), $20,000 (comprehensive)

### ROI Framework

- Identify and recover referral leakage: 10 patients/month × $300 margin = $36K/year
- Optimize payer mix by 3%: $30K/year on $1M revenue
- Reduce patient acquisition cost by 20%: $20K/year savings

---

## Service 4: Operational Analytics

### The Problem

### ROI Framework

- Reduce no-shows by 10%: 50 recovered appointments/month × $200 = $120K/year
- Reduce denial rate by 20%: $50K/year on $2M billing
- Improve scheduling utilization by 15%: Significant capacity unlock

## Service 5: Data Foundation

### The Problem

Data is siloed across 5-15 systems. Getting a simple report takes days. Historical data is messy, duplicated, inconsistent. There's no "single source of truth." Analytics and AI are impossible without fixing this first.

### ROI Framework

- Enable analytics that were previously impossible
- Reduce time spent on manual reporting: 10+ hours/week saved
- Foundation for AI and automation initiatives

---

## Service 6: AI & Automation

### The Problem

Staff spend hours daily on prior authorizations, patient outreach, claims follow-up, and other repetitive tasks. This is work AI can do—but requires clean data and proper implementation.

### What We Deliver

**Tier 5A: Prior Authorization Automation ($15,000-35,000)**

*Timeline:* 10-14 weeks

*Expected outcome:* 30-50% reduction in preventable denials

**Pricing:**
- Prior Auth Automation: $15,000 (basic), $35,000 (full integration)
- Patient Communication: $10,000 (single channel), $25,000 (multi-channel)
- Denial Prevention: $20,000-40,000 depending on volume and complexity

2. "How many different systems do you use? Can you name them?"
3. "When you need a custom report, how long does it take and who does it?"
4. "How do you currently measure your performance against competitors?"
5. "What's your biggest operational headache? (Prior auth, denials, no-shows, scheduling?)"
6. "Have you thought about AI or automation? What's held you back?"
7. "Do you have anyone internally focused on data and analytics?"
8. "What would success look like in 6 months?"

## Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "This is more than we expected to spend" | "Let's start smaller. The Market Positioning Report is $2,500—we prove value before you commit to anything larger. If ROI is there, we expand. If not, you've learned something for a modest investment." |
| "We need to think about it" | "Of course. What would help you make the decision? Happy to provide references, a sample deliverable, or a more detailed scope." |
| "Can you do it cheaper?" | "We can reduce scope to fit budget. But I'd rather do something meaningful well than something comprehensive poorly. What's most important to you?" |
| "We're worried about security/HIPAA" | "We work under BAA and follow healthcare data security best practices. We can walk through our security protocols and sign whatever agreements you need." |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "We start with clear success criteria. If we're not delivering, we'll adjust approach or scope. We're not in the business of charging for work that doesn't help you." |
