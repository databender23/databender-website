# Data Foundation - Page Specification

**URL:** `/services/data-foundation/`

**Page Title:** Data Foundation | Build Your Data Infrastructure | Databender

**Meta Description:** Build the data infrastructure your business needs. Modern data warehouse, automated pipelines, and governance—the foundation for everything else.

## Hero Section

### Headline
**"Build once. Use everywhere."**

### Subheadline
A solid data foundation powers everything—dashboards, reports, AI, automation. We build it right so everything else just works.

### Supporting Text
Most data problems trace back to the same root cause: no proper foundation. Systems don't connect. There's no single source of truth. Nobody knows which number is right. We fix that.

## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Why everything else fails without this"**

### Pain Points

| Symptom | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|
| **Reports don't match** | No single source of truth |
| **Dashboards take forever** | No infrastructure—every report is a one-off project |
| **AI projects fail** | AI trained on messy data gives messy answers |
| **Can't answer basic questions** | Data isn't organized to answer business questions |
| **New tools don't help** | Tools are only as good as the data they connect to |

### The Foundation Problem
You can't build a house on sand. You can't build analytics on scattered, messy, undocumented data. Everything works better with a proper foundation.
