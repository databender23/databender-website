## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Your data is messier than you think"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Business Impact |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Duplicate records** | Same customer in your CRM five times. Marketing sends five emails. Sales doesn't know who's who. |
| **Inconsistent formats** | "IBM" and "International Business Machines" and "I.B.M." all mean the same thing—but your systems don't know that. |
| **Outdated information** | Contacts who left years ago. Addresses that changed. Titles that are wrong. |
| **System disconnects** | Customer in your CRM doesn't match the same customer in your billing system. |

### Cost of Bad Data
- **Sales productivity:** Reps waste 30% of time on bad data
- **Marketing waste:** Campaigns sent to wrong or duplicate contacts
- **Decision quality:** Reports built on inaccurate data lead to wrong decisions
- **AI failure:** AI trained on bad data gives bad answers

## How It Works Section

### Headline
**"AI that learns your data"**

### Process

**Step 1: Assessment**
We analyze your current data across systems. Where are the duplicates? What's inconsistent? How bad is it really?

**Step 2: Training**
Our AI learns your specific business context. What counts as a match in your world? What are the edge cases?

**Step 3: Cleanup**
The AI processes your data—matching records, standardizing formats, flagging uncertain cases for human review.

**Step 4: Ongoing Quality**
This isn't a one-time project. The AI monitors new data, catches problems early, and maintains quality over time.

## FAQ Section

**Q: How long does data cleanup take?**
A: Initial cleanup typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on data volume. But the real value is ongoing—the AI keeps your data clean continuously.

**Q: Will you break anything?**
A: We never modify source systems without your approval. We create cleaned datasets that can be reviewed before any changes are applied.

**Q: What if the AI makes mistakes?**
A: The AI flags uncertain matches for human review. You maintain control over what gets approved.

**Q: How is this different from Salesforce's duplicate detection?**
A: Built-in tools are basic. They catch obvious duplicates but miss variations, don't work across systems, and don't learn your business context.
