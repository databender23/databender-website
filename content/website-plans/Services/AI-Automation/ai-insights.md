## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"You're drowning in data, starving for insights"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **Too much data to analyze** | You have more data than ever, but no more hours in the day to analyze it. |
| **Don't know what to look for** | The most valuable insights are often things you didn't think to ask about. |
| **Insights arrive too late** | By the time you notice a trend in monthly reports, the opportunity (or problem) has already played out. |
| **Analysis is reactive** | You investigate when something goes wrong—but what about opportunities you're missing? |

### The Cost
- Trends spotted too late to act
- Opportunities that never surface
- Problems that grow while unnoticed
- Analysts spending time on routine analysis instead of strategic work
