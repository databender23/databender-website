## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Planning without prediction is just hoping"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Forecasts are guesses** | "What's next quarter look like?" gets answered with intuition, not data |
| **Surprised by outcomes** | Churn, cash flow, demand—you find out after it happens |
| **Can't plan capacity** | How many people? How much inventory? You guess and hope |
| **Missed early warnings** | Warning signs exist—you just can't see them until too late |

### What Prediction Enables
- Confident planning based on data
- Early warning for problems
- Optimized resource allocation
- Better strategic decisions

## What We Build Section

### Headline
**"Predictions that actually help"**

### Prediction Types

| Type | What It Answers | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Demand Forecasting** | How much will we sell/produce? | Sales forecasts, production planning |
| **Customer Predictions** | Who will churn? Who will buy more? | Churn risk, upsell likelihood |
| **Financial Forecasting** | What will cash flow look like? | Revenue projections, expense forecasting |
| **Lead Scoring** | Which leads will convert? | Pipeline prioritization |
| **Capacity Planning** | What resources will we need? | Staffing, inventory levels |

### How Our Predictions Work

**Built on Foundation**
Predictions are only as good as the data they're based on. We start with a solid data foundation—clean, connected, trustworthy.

**Transparent Models**
We don't build black boxes. You'll understand what factors drive predictions and why the model says what it says.

**Continuously Improved**
Models learn from outcomes. As reality unfolds, predictions get better.

## Example Use Cases Section

### Headline
**"Prediction in action"**

### Example 1: Sales Forecasting
```
QUARTERLY REVENUE FORECAST

Predicted Q2 Revenue: $2.8M - $3.1M (80% confidence)

Factors:
• Pipeline coverage: 2.8x (healthy)
• Conversion rate trend: stable at 32%
• Average deal size: increasing (+8%)
• Seasonal pattern: Q2 typically +5% vs Q1

Risks:
• 3 large deals (38% of pipeline) have extended
• New competitor impact unknown
```

### Example 2: Customer Churn
```
CHURN RISK ANALYSIS

High Risk (Action needed): 12 accounts ($420K ARR)
Medium Risk (Monitor): 28 accounts ($680K ARR)
Low Risk: 156 accounts ($2.1M ARR)

Top Risk Factors:
• Support ticket increase (+40%)
• Usage decline (-25%)
• No engagement in 60+ days

Recommended Action: Customer success outreach to
high-risk accounts this week.
```

### Example 3: Lead Scoring (From Real Project)
```
LEAD: John Smith
SCORE: 87/100 (High Priority)

WHY THIS SCORE:
• High home equity (+32 points)        ← Strongest predictor
• Immediate project timeline (+28 points)
• 3 past sales in this ZIP (+11 points) ← Only possible with YOUR data
• Large home (3,200 sq ft) (+8 points)

RECOMMENDATION: Call within 24 hours

WHAT GENERIC TOOLS WOULD HAVE SAID:
• Home value: Average → Medium priority
• Demographics: Standard → No signal

WHAT OUR MODEL DISCOVERED:
• Home EQUITY matters more than home VALUE
• Past company wins in ZIP code predict future wins
• Generic tools would have ranked this lead 40 points lower
```

**Result:** +21% more high-priority leads identified, +754 additional qualified leads per month.

## Our Approach Section

### Headline
**"Custom ML vs. Generic Scoring"**

| Generic Lead Scoring | Custom ML Model |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Industry averages | YOUR wins/losses |
| Same rules for everyone | Tailored to your customers |
| Home value weighted heavily | Discovers what actually matters |
| Black box—no explanations | "Why this score?" visible to reps |
| Static rules | Improves with new data |
| One-size-fits-all | Finds YOUR unique signals |

### Real Example: What Generic Tools Miss

In one project, generic CRM scoring weighted home value as the primary signal. Our custom model discovered:

| Feature | Generic Weight | Actual Importance |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Home Value | High | Nearly irrelevant (+0.04) |
| Home Equity | Not used | Strongest predictor (+1.12) |
| Past Sales in ZIP | Not possible | Strong signal (+0.39) |

**Result:** Generic tools would have missed 21% of the high-priority leads.

### The Foundation Requirement
Prediction requires clean, connected data. If your data foundation isn't ready, we build that first. Predictions built on bad data give bad answers—we won't skip this step.

## FAQ Section

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: Accuracy depends on data quality and the specific problem. We always provide confidence intervals—you'll know how certain the prediction is.

**Q: What if the model is wrong?**
A: Models learn from outcomes. When predictions don't match reality, we investigate why and improve the model.

**Q: How much historical data do we need?**
A: More is better, but we can work with what you have. For most predictions, 12-24 months of history is ideal.

**Q: Is this just Excel forecasting with a fancy name?**
A: No. We use machine learning models that find patterns humans can't see and continuously improve from new data.
