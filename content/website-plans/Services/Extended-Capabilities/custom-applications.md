## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Workarounds aren't solutions"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **No tool fits** | You've evaluated 10 solutions. None do what you need. |
| **Workarounds everywhere** | Spreadsheets, manual steps, and duct tape hold things together. |
| **Integration gaps** | Your tools don't connect, so someone bridges the gap manually. |
| **Process doesn't match** | Off-the-shelf assumes a generic process. Yours isn't generic. |

### When Custom Makes Sense
- Unique workflows no standard tool handles
- Integrations between systems that don't connect
- Internal tools that increase efficiency
- Customer-facing applications for competitive advantage

## Example Projects Section

### Headline
**"What custom builds look like"**

### Example 1: Operations Management Portal
**Problem:** Multi-location business with no unified view of daily operations.
**Solution:** Custom dashboard pulling from 5 different systems, with role-based views for different teams.
**Result:** Operations managers see everything in one place instead of logging into 5 systems.

### Example 2: Client Reporting Portal
**Problem:** Clients wanted self-service access to their data without calling for reports.
**Solution:** Custom portal with secure login, automated reports, and interactive dashboards.
**Result:** 80% reduction in report requests; improved client satisfaction.

### Example 3: Integration Platform
**Problem:** Legacy system had no API; manual data entry was required.
**Solution:** Custom integration layer that syncs data automatically.
**Result:** Eliminated 20 hours/week of manual data entry.
