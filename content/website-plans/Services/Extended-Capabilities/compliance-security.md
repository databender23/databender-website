| **Bolted-on security** | Adding compliance after the fact is expensive and incomplete |
| **Audit anxiety** | Can you prove you're compliant if someone asks? |
| **PHI/PII exposure** | One mistake with sensitive data can be catastrophic |
| **Access control gaps** | Who can see what? Are you sure? |

### What Compliance Requires
- Proper data handling from the start
- Access controls and audit trails
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## How We Approach Compliance Section

### Headline
**"Compliance by design"**

### Process

**Step 1: Requirements**
What regulations apply? What's your risk tolerance? What existing controls exist?

**Step 2: Architecture**
Design systems with compliance built in—not added later.

**Step 3: Implementation**
Build with security and compliance as core requirements, not nice-to-haves.

**Step 4: Documentation**
Create the documentation auditors will ask for.

**Step 5: Validation**
Test controls, verify compliance, prepare for audits.

### Our Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Least privilege** | People only access what they need |
| **Defense in depth** | Multiple layers of protection |
| **Assume breach** | Design for when (not if) something goes wrong |
| **Evidence first** | If you can't prove it, it doesn't count |
