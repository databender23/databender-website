## The Challenge Section

### Headline
**"Growth creates complexity"**

### Pain Points

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Every location is an island** | Different PM systems, different processes, no unified view |
| **Can't compare locations** | Without consistent data, comparing performance is guesswork |
| **Reporting takes forever** | Pulling monthly reports from 10+ locations takes a week |
| **Problems hide** | Underperforming locations aren't obvious until it's too late |
| **Acquisitions make it worse** | Each acquisition brings another system, more complexity |

### The PE Challenge
If you're PE-backed, the pressure is higher. Board meetings need data. Investors want visibility. You need to demonstrate value creation. Fragmented data makes all of this harder.
