## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Growth is great. The data mess isn't."**

### The DSO Reality
> You've built a group of 15 practices. 8 are on Dentrix. 4 are on Eaglesoft. 2 are on Open Dental. 1 is on something obscure from 2005.
>
> Each location reports differently. Monthly reporting is a week-long exercise. Your regional managers spend more time pulling data than analyzing it.
>
> You know some practices are underperforming. But which ones? And why?

### Pain Points

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **No unified view** | Can't see portfolio performance at a glance |
| **Reporting takes forever** | Week+ to produce monthly board package |
| **Can't compare apples to apples** | Different definitions, different metrics across systems |
| **Acquisitions make it worse** | Every deal adds another system to reconcile |
| **Providers vary wildly** | Production per provider varies 3x but you don't know who needs coaching |
