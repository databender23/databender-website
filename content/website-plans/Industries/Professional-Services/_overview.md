## The Challenge Section

### Headline
**"Your biggest asset is invisible"**

### Pain Points

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Knowledge is scattered** | Prior work exists—somewhere. Finding it means asking around and hoping someone remembers. |
| **New associates start from zero** | Instead of leveraging firm precedent, they reinvent approaches case by case. |
| **Client relationships are siloed** | One partner knows the client deeply. Everyone else knows nothing. |
| **Utilization is a mystery** | Until month-end close, you're guessing at profitability. |
| **People leave, knowledge leaves** | When partners retire, decades of expertise walk out the door. |
