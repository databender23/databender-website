## Purpose

This page helps prospects understand why AI-powered data cleanup is superior to traditional manual approaches. Target audience:
- Companies who have done manual cleanup before and seen problems return
- Companies getting quotes for data cleanup projects
- Companies who think cleanup is too expensive
- Companies concerned about data quality for AI initiatives

## Hero Section

### Headline
**"What costs $25,000 in analyst time, AI completes for $200"**

### Subheadline
Manual data cleanup is expensive, slow, and temporary. AI agents reason through each decision like your best analyst—but at 125x the cost efficiency, with complete documentation.

### Proof Point
> *Real project: 1.69M records cleaned in 3 weeks. 50,000+ decisions validated. 125x cost savings.*

## The Comparison

### Headline
**"Same quality decisions. Fraction of the cost."**

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Factor | Manual Cleanup | AI-Powered Cleanup |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | $25,000+ for 50K decisions | ~$200 for same work |
| **Time** | 500+ analyst hours | 3 weeks |
| **Coverage** | Spot-checks (5-10%) | 100% of decisions |
| **Consistency** | Subjective, varies by analyst | Consistent reasoning framework |
| **Audit Trail** | None or minimal notes | Complete reasoning for every decision |
| **Scalability** | Linear cost increase | Marginal cost increase |
| **Accuracy** | Depends on analyst skill | 99%+ with edge case handling |
| **Sustainability** | One-time fix, problems return | Ongoing monitoring available |

## Why Manual Cleanup Fails

### Headline
**"The hidden costs of 'doing it manually'"**

### Problem 1: It's Too Expensive
For a typical cleanup requiring 50,000+ validation decisions:
- **Analyst time:** 500+ hours at $50/hr = $25,000+
- **Opportunity cost:** Skilled people doing tedious work
- **Management overhead:** Training, QA, coordination

### Problem 2: Spot-Checks Miss Problems
Realistically, analysts can only review 5-10% of decisions:
- **The 90% unchecked:** Assumed correct, often wrong
- **Systematic errors:** Patterns repeated thousands of times
- **Edge cases:** Unusual situations handled inconsistently

### Problem 3: No Audit Trail
When questions arise later:
- **"Why was this merged?"** — No one knows
- **"Who made this decision?"** — Can't trace
- **Compliance/legal issues:** No documentation to review

### Problem 4: Problems Return
Manual cleanup is a one-time project:
- **New data enters dirty:** Same problems reappear
- **No ongoing monitoring:** Issues compound until next cleanup
- **Repeat spending:** Same project every 1-2 years

## How AI Cleanup Works

### Headline
**"AI agents that reason like your best analyst"**

### The Process

```
1. ALGORITHMIC MATCHING
   ↓ Narrow millions of records to thousands of decisions

2. AI AGENT REVIEW
   ↓ Each agent reasons through decisions with full context

3. CONFIDENCE SCORING
   ↓ High-confidence decisions proceed, uncertain cases flagged

4. HUMAN REVIEW (Edge Cases Only)
   ↓ Your team reviews only the genuinely ambiguous cases

5. DOCUMENTATION
   ↓ Every decision has a complete reasoning trail
```

### What AI Reasoning Looks Like

```
DECISION: Should "JR Smith" match to "J Smith"?

REASONING:
- Both records show Tyler, TX address
- "JR" commonly abbreviates first + middle initial
- Address patterns match across both records
- No conflicting evidence (different cities, states)
- Similar property patterns in ownership history

CONFIDENCE: High (92%)
RECOMMENDATION: Match - likely same person
```

This reasoning is documented for every decision—not just spot-checked samples.

## Real Project Results

### Headline
**"Proof from a real project"**

### Case Study: Mineral Rights Entity Resolution

**The Challenge:**
- 1.69 million owner records
- Two corruption patterns: Collision IDs (670 strangers sharing one ID) and Unstable IDs (same person with 4 different IDs)
- 50,000+ decisions requiring validation

**The Approach:**
- AI agents reviewed every decision in parallel
- Full reasoning documented for each
- Human review only for edge cases below confidence threshold

**The Results:**

| Metric | Manual Estimate | AI Actual |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Cost | $25,000+ | ~$200 |
| Time | 500+ hours | 3 weeks |
| Coverage | Spot-checks | 100% |
| Documentation | None | Complete |

**Business Impact:**
- 1.25M unique owners properly identified
- 4,817 exclude-list matches found (84% match rate)
- 268+ systematic errors discovered and fixed
- Complete audit trail for compliance

## When Each Approach Makes Sense

### Headline
**"Honest assessment"**

### Manual Cleanup May Be Right If:
- Dataset is small (<1,000 records)
- Decisions require deep domain expertise humans have but can't articulate
- One-time cleanup with no ongoing needs
- Internal staff have available bandwidth

### AI Cleanup Is Better If:
- Dataset is large (10,000+ records)
- Decisions can be reasoned through with context
- Audit trail is important for compliance
- Ongoing quality monitoring is needed
- Cost efficiency matters
- You've done manual cleanup before and problems returned

## FAQ

**Q: Can AI really make the same decisions a human would?**
A: For data matching decisions, yes. AI agents analyze the same context a human would (names, addresses, patterns, history) and apply consistent reasoning. The difference: AI does it at scale with documentation.

**Q: What about edge cases AI can't handle?**
A: AI assigns confidence scores. Low-confidence cases are flagged for human review. You handle the genuinely ambiguous cases; AI handles the clear ones.

**Q: Is the $200 figure real?**
A: Yes, for AI processing costs on a project with 50,000+ decisions. Total project cost includes setup, configuration, and human review of edge cases—but still a fraction of manual approaches.

**Q: What if AI makes mistakes?**
A: Every decision is documented with reasoning. If a decision was wrong, you can see why and correct it. With manual cleanup, you often can't even identify which decisions were wrong.

**Q: How do you prevent problems from returning?**
A: AI cleanup can include ongoing monitoring—catching new data quality issues before they compound. Manual cleanup is always a one-time project.
