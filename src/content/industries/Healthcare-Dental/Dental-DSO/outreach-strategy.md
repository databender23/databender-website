# Dental DSO Outreach Strategy

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Message

> **"Your data and analytics team—without the department."**
>
> PE-backed dental groups need enterprise-grade data capabilities but can't justify building an internal analytics team at every stage of growth. Databender provides on-demand expertise in analytics, BI, and AI—helping you achieve margin visibility and operational consistency across your portfolio.

### Why DSOs Need External Data Support

Multi-location dental groups face unique challenges:

- **Acquired practices run different systems** — no unified view
- **Board expects KPIs** — but data is manual and inconsistent
- **Margin visibility is primitive** — location-level P&L, not profitability by provider or procedure
- **Can't hire fast enough** — analytics talent is expensive and scarce

### Why Us vs. Software

| What They're Considering | Why Databender Wins |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| "We'll buy Dental Intel or Jarvis" | Software requires someone to implement, configure for your specific situation, and integrate across different PMS platforms. You get the tool, not the outcome. We deliver outcomes. |
| "We'll hire a data analyst" | A good analyst costs $100K+. You can't afford a data engineer ($150K) AND analyst AND data scientist for a platform your size. We're all three, on demand. |
| "Our PMS has reports" | PMS reports are siloed by location and can't compare across platforms. We integrate everything—Dentrix, Open Dental, Eaglesoft, whatever you run—into unified insights. |
| "Corporate will build it eventually" | Your ops team should focus on running practices, not wrangling data. We deliver now while you figure out long-term staffing. |

### The Bridge Positioning

> "We're not trying to replace your future data team. We're the bridge that gets you there—delivering value now while you scale. When you hire, we'll train them and hand off."

## Target Audience

### Primary Segment: PE-Backed DSO Platforms

| Characteristic | Implication |
|----------------|-------------|
| Professional management (COO, VP Ops, CFO) | Easier to reach decision-maker; speaks "ROI" and "EBITDA" |
| Board/investor reporting requirements | Need dashboards and KPIs, not just insights |
| Acquiring new practices | Need to standardize analytics across sites |
| 3-5 year exit timeline | Willing to invest for measurable improvement and clean data |
| Multiple PMS platforms | Critical pain point—different systems at every location |

**Size sweet spot:** 10-50 locations

- Below 10: May not have budget or dedicated ops leadership
- Above 50: More likely to have internal data team (but may still need help)

### Secondary Segment: Independent Multi-Location Groups

| Characteristic | Implication |
|----------------|-------------|
| Owner-operator or small leadership team | Harder to reach; wears many hats |
| Less formal reporting requirements | Lead with operational efficiency, not board decks |
| Slower decision-making | Need lower entry points and clear ROI |
| May be acquisition target | Position data readiness as exit preparation |

### Titles to Target

**Primary (Decision Makers):**
- Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- VP Operations / Regional Director
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- VP Finance
- CEO (smaller platforms)

**Secondary (Influencers):**
- Director of Operations
- Director of Practice Support
- IT Director
- Integration/M&A Lead

## Messaging Framework

### Opening Hooks (Choose Based on Context)

**Profitability Visibility Hook:**
> "Quick question: do you have visibility into profitability by location and provider—or just revenue? Most DSOs I talk to know their top-line but can't pinpoint where margin is leaking."

**Post-Acquisition Hook:**
> "I noticed you've acquired [X] practices in the past year. How are you handling data integration? Getting a unified view when every practice runs different systems is a common pain point."

**Payer Mix Hook:**
> "When's your next round of payer contract negotiations? Most DSOs go in without clear data on which contracts are actually profitable—and which are losing money."

**Operational Visibility Hook:**
> "How do your regional directors know which locations need attention? Real-time visibility vs. monthly spreadsheets makes a big difference for platform-level management."

**Exit Preparation Hook:**
> "I work with DSO platforms preparing for PE transactions. Clean, standardized data across locations can meaningfully impact multiples. Is exit on the horizon?"

### Value Proposition by Need

| If They Care About... | Lead With... |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Board/investor reporting | Practice profitability dashboards, standardized KPIs across locations |
| Margin improvement | Provider-level profitability, payer contract analysis, operational efficiency |
| Acquisition integration | Post-acquisition data integration, unified view across PMS platforms |
| Operational consistency | Operational command center, chair utilization, case acceptance tracking |
| Exit preparation | Clean data foundation, demonstrable KPIs, standardized reporting |
| Reducing admin burden | AI automation for patient outreach, verification, recalls |

### Full Service Message

> "We help DSO platforms get visibility and control over their data. That might start with understanding profitability by location—but it extends to payer analytics, operational dashboards, acquisition integration, and automation. We're your data team, on demand."

## Outreach Channels

### 1. LinkedIn (Primary)

**Profile Optimization:**
- Headline: "Data & Analytics for Dental Groups | Helping DSOs See What's Actually Happening"
- About: Focus on outcomes for multi-location dental—profitability, operations, integration
- Featured: Link to relevant case study or insight piece

**Connection Strategy:**
- Target: COOs, VP Ops, CFOs at DSOs with 10-50 locations
- Connection request: Keep short, no pitch
  > "Hi [Name], I work with dental groups on data and analytics. Would be great to connect."
- After connection: Engage with their content before pitching

**Direct Outreach Approaches:**

*Approach 1: Profitability Visibility*
> "Hi [Name], quick question: do you have visibility into profitability by location and provider—or just revenue?
>
> Most DSO platforms I work with struggle to get a clear picture, especially when locations run different PMS systems.
>
> We help platforms like yours build unified profitability views across sites. Would a quick conversation be useful?"

*Approach 2: Post-Acquisition*
> "Hi [Name], I noticed [DSO Name] has been active on the acquisition front. Congrats on the growth.
>
> One pattern I see: every new practice brings a different system, and getting a unified view takes forever—or never happens.
>
> We help DSOs integrate acquired practice data quickly, even before PMS migration. Is that a pain point for you?"

*Approach 3: Payer Analytics*
> "Hi [Name], when's your next round of payer contract negotiations?
>
> We help DSO platforms go in with real data—which contracts are profitable, where you're leaving money on the table, and what to prioritize.
>
> Would a quick conversation about your payer analytics be useful?"

*Approach 4: Board Deck Pain*
> "Hi [Name], how long does it take your team to pull together board/investor reporting each month?
>
> For most DSO platforms, it's a multi-day fire drill because data lives in different systems at different locations.
>
> We build centralized dashboards that pull from all your locations—even when they run different PMS. Worth a conversation?"

### 2. Email Outreach

**When to Use:**
- Following up after LinkedIn connection
- Reaching decision-makers not active on LinkedIn
- Trigger-based outreach (acquisitions, leadership changes)

**Subject Lines (Test):**
- "Quick question about [DSO Name] data"
- "Profitability visibility across your locations?"
- "Saw [DSO Name] acquired [practice]—integration question"
- "Preparing [DSO Name] for board reporting?"

**Cold Email Template (Profitability Focus):**
```
Subject: Profitability visibility across your locations?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: do you have visibility into profitability by location and provider—or just revenue?

Most DSO platforms I work with know their top-line numbers but struggle to pinpoint where margin is leaking. When every location runs a different PMS, getting a unified view is especially painful.

We help DSO platforms build standardized profitability views across sites—so you can see which locations, providers, and payer contracts are actually driving margin.

Would a 15-minute call to see if this is relevant for [DSO Name] be worthwhile?

[Name]
Databender Consulting
```

**Cold Email Template (Acquisition Focus):**
```
Subject: Saw [DSO Name] acquired [practice]—integration question

Hi [Name],

Congrats on the acquisition of [practice]. I imagine the integration is underway.

One pattern I see with growing DSOs: every new acquisition brings different systems, and getting a unified data view takes months—or never happens. Leadership ends up with partial visibility and lots of manual work.

We help DSO platforms integrate acquired practice data quickly, even before PMS migration. Your ops team gets visibility in weeks, not quarters.

Worth a conversation?

[Name]
Databender Consulting
```

## Objection Handling

### Software & DIY Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have Dental Intel / Jarvis" | "Those are useful tools—but they're designed for single practices, not multi-location visibility. Someone still needs to connect them across your platform and build what they don't offer. We can work alongside them or fill the gaps." |
| "Our PMS has reports" | "PMS reports are great for single-location metrics. But can you compare profitability across locations when you're running Dentrix at some sites and Open Dental at others? That's what we build." |
| "We should build this internally" | "Absolutely—long-term that makes sense. But a good data analyst costs $100K+, and it takes months to hire and ramp. We're your bridge: delivering value now while you build that capability. When you're ready, we train your team and hand off." |

### Timing & Budget Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Not a priority right now" | "Understood. When would be a better time? And in the meantime, I'd be happy to send you a brief analysis of what profitability visibility could mean for your platform—just to have when you're ready." |
| "We don't have budget for this" | "The entry point is $5,000-7,500. If it helps you identify one margin leak, optimize one payer contract, or catch one underperforming location faster, it's paid for many times over. This is a business investment." |
| "We're in the middle of an acquisition" | "Perfect timing, actually. That's exactly when visibility matters most—and when data integration becomes critical. Happy to talk about how we support the acquisition process specifically." |

### Trust Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We've been burned by consultants before" | "I hear that a lot. That's why we start small—a focused project with clear deliverables. You see results before committing to anything larger. We're not disappearing after a fancy PowerPoint." |
| "How do we know you understand dental?" | "We've worked with healthcare organizations on exactly these challenges—data integration across locations, margin visibility, operational analytics. And we're specialized in the complexity of multi-location, multi-system environments. Happy to share specifics." |
