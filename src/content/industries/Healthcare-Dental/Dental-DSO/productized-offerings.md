# Dental DSO Productized Offerings

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition

> **"Your data and analytics team—without the department."**
>
> PE-backed dental groups need enterprise-grade data capabilities but can't justify a dedicated analytics team at each stage of growth. Databender provides on-demand expertise in analytics, BI, and AI—helping you achieve margin visibility and operational consistency across your portfolio without the overhead.

### Why DSOs Need This

Multi-location dental groups face unique data challenges:

- **Acquired practices use different systems** — each acquisition brings new PMS, imaging, and billing platforms
- **No standardized view across locations** — leadership can't compare apples to apples
- **Margin visibility is primitive** — you know total revenue, not profitability by location, provider, or procedure
- **PE expectations require data** — board decks need real KPIs, not best guesses

### What We Really Offer

We're not selling dashboards. We're selling **outcomes**:
- Clear visibility into which locations and providers drive profit
- Standardized analytics across acquired practices
- Data that supports payer negotiations and EBITDA improvement
- Operational intelligence without building an internal team

### Why Us vs. Alternatives

| Alternative | What's Missing | Why Databender Wins |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Buy analytics software** (Dental Intel, Jarvis, etc.) | Someone to implement, configure for your specific situation, integrate across platforms | We deliver outcomes, not tools. We can implement software AND build what you need. |
| **Use PMS reports** | Cross-location visibility, custom analytics, integration across acquired systems | PMS reports are basic and siloed. We integrate PMS + billing + imaging into unified intelligence. |
| **Hire internally** | Analyst: $100K+. Engineer: $150K+. Data scientist: $180K+. Plus 6-12 months to hire and ramp. | Fractional access to senior expertise. All three roles, on demand, without the overhead. |
| **Wait for corporate to build it** | Time. You need visibility now, not in 2 years. | We deliver in weeks. Prove value while you figure out long-term staffing. |
| **DIY** | Time, expertise, consistency across locations | Your ops team should focus on running practices, not wrangling data. |

### The Bridge Positioning

> "We're not trying to replace your future data team. We're the bridge that gets you there—delivering value now while you scale. When you hire, we'll train them and hand off."

## Service 1: Practice Profitability Analytics

### The Problem

Most DSOs know total revenue by location. Very few know true profitability by location, provider, or procedure—especially after accounting for overhead allocation, provider compensation, and payer mix. This lack of visibility leads to bad decisions: overpaying underperforming providers, keeping unprofitable locations, missing margin improvement opportunities.

This problem is especially acute for:
- **PE-backed DSO platforms** acquiring practices with different cost structures
- **Multi-specialty groups** (GP + ortho + perio) with mixed margin profiles
- **Growing platforms** where leadership can't visit every location regularly

## Service 2: Payer Analytics & Contract Performance

### The Problem

DSOs negotiate contracts at the platform level but lack visibility into actual performance by payer, location, and procedure. They accept rate increases that sound good but don't know if specific payers are profitable at all. They can't identify which contracts to prioritize for renegotiation.

## Service 3: Operational Dashboards

### The Problem

Leadership can't see what's happening across locations in real-time. They learn about problems weeks or months after the fact. Chair utilization, case acceptance, hygiene recall—these are managed by spreadsheet or not at all. Underperforming locations fly under the radar.

### What We Deliver

**Tier 3A: Operational Health Assessment ($7,500-12,500)**

- Analysis of key operational metrics across locations
- Chair utilization by location and day
- Case acceptance rates by provider

*Deliverables:*
- Operational assessment report (20-25 pages)
- Location performance scorecards
- Provider-level metrics
- Action plan with ROI estimates

*Timeline:* 3-4 weeks

*Ideal for:* DSOs lacking operational visibility; groups suspecting inconsistency

**Tier 3B: Operational Command Center ($15,000-30,000)**

- Real-time dashboards for:
  - Chair utilization (by location, provider, day of week)
  - Production vs. goals (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Case acceptance and treatment plan conversion
  - Hygiene recall rates and reactivation
  - New patient flow and source
  - Key alerts and exceptions
- Mobile-accessible for regional directors
- Training for ops team
- 90 days of support

*Deliverables:*
- Interactive operational dashboards
- Alert system for key metrics
- Location comparison views
- Training and documentation

*Timeline:* 6-8 weeks

*Ideal for:* DSOs with 10+ locations; groups with regional structure needing visibility

**Pricing:**
- Operational Health Assessment: $7,500 (up to 10 locations), $12,500 (11-30 locations)
- Operational Command Center: $15,000-30,000 depending on scope and locations

### ROI Framework

- Improve chair utilization by 10%: Significant production unlock

## Service 4: Post-Acquisition Data Integration

### The Problem

Every acquisition brings new systems. The platform runs on Dentrix, but the new practice uses Open Dental. Or Eaglesoft. Or something custom. There's no way to get a unified view without weeks of manual work. Historical data is trapped in legacy systems.

### What We Deliver

**Tier 4A: Acquisition Data Integration ($10,000-25,000 per acquisition)**

- Connect acquired practice data to platform reporting
- Map procedures, codes, and providers across systems
- Establish data extraction pipelines

- Documentation for IT handoff

*Deliverables:*
- Data integration pipelines
- Code and provider mapping documentation
- Transitional dashboards
- Technical documentation for ongoing maintenance

*Timeline:* 4-6 weeks per acquisition

*Ideal for:* Active acquirers who can't wait for PMS migration to get visibility

**Tier 4B: Platform Data Foundation ($25,000-50,000)**

- Unified data model across all locations and PMS platforms
- Master data management (patients, providers, procedures)
- Historical data normalization
- Centralized data warehouse
- Foundation for all analytics and reporting

*Deliverables:*
- Centralized data warehouse
- Unified data model
- Data quality monitoring
- Documentation and governance playbook

*Timeline:* 8-12 weeks

*Ideal for:* DSOs with 15+ locations on multiple systems; platforms preparing for PE transaction

**Pricing:**
- Single Acquisition Integration: $10,000-15,000
- Multi-Acquisition Package (3+): $20,000-25,000 per acquisition
- Platform Data Foundation: $25,000-50,000 depending on complexity

### ROI Framework

- Visibility into acquired practices within weeks, not months
- Accurate roll-up reporting for board/investors
- Foundation for all analytics initiatives
- Critical for exit preparation (clean data = higher multiples)

2. "How many different practice management systems are you running across locations?"
3. "What does your board want to see that you can't easily produce today?"
4. "How do you currently know which locations are performing well vs. struggling?"
5. "How do you handle data when you acquire a new practice?"
6. "What's your biggest frustration with getting data from your locations?"
7. "Do you have anyone internally focused on data and analytics?"
8. "What would success look like in 6 months?"

## Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "This is more than we expected to spend" | "Let's start smaller. The Practice Profitability Analysis is $5,000-7,500—we prove value before you commit to anything larger. If ROI is there, we expand. If not, you've learned something for a modest investment." |
| "We have Dental Intel / Jarvis / Practice Analytics" | "Those are useful tools—but someone still needs to integrate them across your locations, connect to other data sources, and build what they don't offer out of the box. We can work alongside them or build custom solutions where they fall short." |
| "Our corporate team is building this" | "Great—we can accelerate that. We often help companies get visibility now while building internal capability. When your team is ready, we train them and hand off. Think of us as the bridge." |
| "We need to think about it" | "Of course. What would help you make the decision? Happy to provide references from other DSO platforms, a sample deliverable, or a more detailed scope." |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "We start with clear success criteria. If we're not delivering, we'll adjust approach or scope. We're not in the business of charging for work that doesn't help you." |
