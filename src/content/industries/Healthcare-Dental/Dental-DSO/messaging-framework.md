# Dental DSO Messaging Framework

## Core Positioning

### The One-Liner

**For internal use:** "We give PE-backed dental groups enterprise-grade data visibility—profitability by location, payer analytics, operational dashboards—without building an internal data team."

**For prospects:** "We help DSOs see what's actually happening across their locations—which practices are profitable, which payers to renegotiate, which operations need attention—so you can make decisions with data, not gut feel."

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "PE-backed dental groups have a visibility problem. You know revenue by location, but not profitability by provider or payer. Every acquired practice runs different systems. Your board expects KPIs that take days to assemble.
>
> We're your data and analytics team—without the department. We connect your systems, build the dashboards, and deliver the insights. You get enterprise-grade visibility at a fraction of what it would cost to build internally."

### The Full Value Proposition

> **For DSOs with 10-50 locations:**
>
> Your platform is growing, but your data isn't keeping up. Every acquisition brings different systems. Your board expects visibility you can't easily provide. You know some locations are underperforming, but you can't pinpoint why.
>
> Enterprise DSOs have data teams. You don't—and you shouldn't have to at your stage.
>
> **Databender fills the gap:**
> - Unified analytics across locations, even when they run different PMS
> - Profitability by location, provider, and payer—not just revenue
> - Operational dashboards for real-time visibility
> - Rapid integration when you acquire new practices
> - Board-ready reporting without the fire drill
>
> **The result:** You make decisions with data. You catch problems before they become crises. You go into payer negotiations with real numbers. And you prepare for exit with clean, standardized data.
>
> **Your data team, on demand. Right-sized for your stage.**

## Messaging by Pain Point

### Pain Point 1: Post-Acquisition Data Integration

**The problem in one sentence:**
> "We bought 5 practices, and the data is a mess."

**Key messages:**

| Message | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| "Every acquisition brings different systems. Getting a unified view takes months—or never happens." | Opening, acquisition-focused buyers |
| "Your ops team is making decisions about new locations with partial visibility." | When they acknowledge integration challenges |
| "We can get you visibility into acquired practices in weeks, not quarters—even before PMS migration." | Solution positioning |
| "Integration doesn't have to block insight. We bridge the gap." | Urgency angle |

**Proof points:**
- Average DSO acquisition takes 6-12 months to fully integrate data
- Many platforms never achieve unified view across all locations
- Leadership makes strategic decisions with incomplete information

**Example scenario:**
```
BEFORE: DSO acquires 3 practices

  -> Each runs different PMS (Dentrix, Open Dental, Eaglesoft)
  -> Different coding conventions, different report formats
  -> Corporate can see revenue but not profitability
  -> Six months later: "How are those acquisitions performing?"
  -> Hours of manual work to get partial answer

  Result: Decisions made without data. Problems discovered late.

AFTER: Rapid data integration

  -> Connect to acquired practice systems within 4-6 weeks
  -> Standardized reporting across all locations
  -> Unified profitability view including new practices
  -> Real-time visibility into acquisition performance

  Result: Faster decisions. Earlier problem detection. Better outcomes.
```

### Pain Point 2: Per-Location Profitability

**The problem in one sentence:**
> "Which locations are actually profitable? We have no idea."

**Key messages:**

| Message | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| "You know revenue by location. But do you know profitability by location, provider, and payer?" | Opening, profitability-focused buyers |
| "Revenue is vanity. Profitability is sanity. Most DSOs track the former but not the latter." | When they acknowledge they only see revenue |
| "Your board cares about EBITDA. Can you show them where margin is being made—and lost?" | Board reporting angle |
| "One underperforming location can drag down platform economics for months before you notice." | Urgency angle |

**Proof points:**
- Revenue variance between locations often masks profitability variance
- Provider compensation rarely tied to actual profitability
- Overhead allocation differences distort location-level P&L

**Example scenario:**
```
BEFORE: DSO tracks revenue by location

  -> Location A: $1.2M revenue
  -> Location B: $1.1M revenue
  -> Conclusion: "Location A is doing better"

  Reality (unknown):
  -> Location A: $1.2M revenue, 8% margin (bad payer mix, high overhead)
  -> Location B: $1.1M revenue, 18% margin (good payer mix, efficient ops)

  Result: Location B is 2x more profitable, but no one knows.

AFTER: Profitability analytics

  -> Clear view of margin by location, provider, payer
  -> Identify that Location A's payer mix is killing margin
  -> Action: Renegotiate contracts, adjust patient acquisition strategy

  Result: Margin improvement across platform.
```

### Pain Point 3: Payer Mix Optimization

**The problem in one sentence:**
> "Which insurance contracts should we renegotiate—or drop?"

**Key messages:**

| Message | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| "When's your next round of payer negotiations? Do you have the data to support your asks?" | Opening, payer-focused buyers |
| "Some payer contracts look good on paper but lose money in practice. Do you know which ones?" | When they acknowledge payer uncertainty |
| "Dropping an unprofitable network isn't just about the revenue you lose—it's about the capacity you free up." | Strategic angle |
| "Market rate data gives you leverage. Going in blind costs you money." | Negotiation support angle |

**Proof points:**
- Most DSOs can't identify their top 3 most profitable payers
- Fee schedule variances within same payer across locations are common
- Negotiation leverage comes from data, not guesswork

**Example scenario:**
```
BEFORE: Payer contract renewal

  -> Payer offers 3% rate increase
  -> DSO accepts because "3% is better than nothing"
  -> No visibility into whether this payer is profitable at all

  Reality (unknown):
  -> This payer pays 15% below market for high-volume procedures
  -> 3% increase still leaves it 12% below market
  -> Other DSOs in market are getting 8-10% increases

  Result: Money left on the table.

AFTER: Payer analytics

  -> Clear view of profitability by payer and procedure
  -> Market rate benchmarking for negotiation
  -> Data-backed ask: "We're 15% below market; we need 10%"

  Result: Better rates, or strategic decision to exit unprofitable network.
```

---

### Pain Point 4: Operational Visibility

**The problem in one sentence:**
> "Why is this location underperforming?"

**Key messages:**

| Message | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| "How do your regional directors know which locations need attention?" | Opening, operationally-focused buyers |
| "By the time you see it in monthly reports, the problem has been going on for weeks." | Real-time visibility angle |
| "Chair utilization, case acceptance, hygiene recall—these drive profitability. Can you see them across all locations?" | Specific metrics angle |
| "The difference between high-performing and struggling locations is often operational, not demographic." | Problem diagnosis angle |

**Proof points:**
- 10% improvement in chair utilization = significant production increase
- Case acceptance rates vary 20-30% across providers at same location
- Hygiene recall drives lifetime patient value and early problem detection

**Example scenario:**
```
BEFORE: Monthly operations review

  -> Regional director reviews spreadsheet at month-end
  -> Location 7 production down 15%
  -> Investigation starts: why?
  -> Takes 2 weeks to diagnose: chair utilization dropped, case acceptance down

  Result: 6+ weeks of underperformance before action.

AFTER: Operational command center

  -> Real-time dashboard shows Location 7 chair utilization dropped Week 1
  -> Alert triggers: "Location 7 utilization below threshold"
  -> Immediate investigation and intervention

  Result: Problems caught in days, not months.
```

## Messaging by Situation

### Cold Outreach (No Trigger)

**LinkedIn connection request:**
> "Hi [Name], I work with dental groups on data and analytics. Would be great to connect."

**Initial message after connection:**
> "Thanks for connecting. I've been working with DSOs like [DSO Name] on a specific challenge: getting visibility across locations when every practice runs different systems.
>
> Curious: is that something you've solved, or is it still a pain point?"

---

### Trigger-Based Outreach

**Acquisition announcement:**
> "Hi [Name], congrats on the acquisition of [practice/group]. Exciting growth.
>
> One pattern I see: every new acquisition brings different systems, and getting a unified data view takes months—or never happens.
>
> We help DSOs integrate acquired practice data quickly, even before PMS migration. Worth a conversation about your integration approach?"

**Leadership change (new COO/VP Ops):**
> "Hi [Name], congrats on the new role at [DSO Name]. Exciting time to join.
>
> New ops leaders I talk to often inherit a visibility gap—knowing what's happening across locations, especially when systems aren't standardized.
>
> If that resonates, happy to share how we've helped similar platforms. Worth a quick conversation?"

**PE investment announcement:**
> "Hi [Name], congrats on the [funding/PE partnership] announcement. Exciting milestone.
>
> One thing I see with newly PE-backed platforms: the board expects visibility and KPIs that the data infrastructure wasn't built to support.
>
> We help DSOs build enterprise-grade analytics without enterprise-grade headcount. Worth a conversation about what you're working toward?"

---

### Follow-Up Messages

**After discovery call (moving forward):**
> "Great speaking with you, [Name]. As discussed, I'll put together [proposal/scope/next step] and have it to you by [date].
>
> In the meantime, I'm attaching [relevant example] that covers some of what we discussed. Let me know if questions come up."

**After discovery call (not moving forward now):**
> "I appreciate the conversation, [Name]. Sounds like the timing isn't right for [reason].
>
> I'll add you to our quarterly update—we share DSO-focused insights without sales pitches. Feel free to unsubscribe if not useful.
>
> If anything changes—especially around [specific trigger], don't hesitate to reach out."

---

### Objection Response Messages

**"We're looking at Dental Intel / Jarvis / other software":**
> "Those are solid tools for single-practice analytics. Where they typically fall short is multi-location visibility—especially when you're running different PMS platforms across sites.
>
> We're not replacing that software; we're adding the layer that connects it all together. Most of our clients use us alongside those tools.
>
> What's the primary problem you're trying to solve?"

**"We're building this internally":**
> "Makes sense—long-term that's often the right move. A couple questions:
>
> How long before that capability is live? And what visibility do you have in the meantime?
>
> We often serve as the bridge—delivering value now while you build internal capability. When your team is ready, we train them and hand off."

**"We're too small for this":**
> "Actually, platforms in the 10-30 location range often get the most value. Large DSOs have internal data teams. You don't—which means you need efficient solutions more, not less.
>
> What we build isn't enterprise pricing shoved into a smaller platform. It's right-sized for your stage. Worth seeing what the economics look like?"

## Quick Reference Card

### The 3 Questions to Ask in Every Conversation

1. "Do you have visibility into profitability by location, provider, and payer—or just revenue?"
2. "How do you handle data when you acquire a new practice?"
3. "What's your biggest frustration with data and reporting today?"

### The 3 Things to Establish Early

1. **We're fractional, not replacement:** "We're your data team on demand—not trying to replace what you'll build eventually."
2. **We work across systems:** "Different PMS at different locations? That's exactly what we solve."
3. **We start small and prove value:** "We'll start with a focused project, prove ROI, then expand."

### The 3 Proof Points That Matter

1. **Time/money:** "$X saved in reporting time; $Y identified in margin leakage"
2. **Speed:** "Visibility in weeks, not months after acquisition"
3. **Specificity:** "Profitability by location, provider, and payer—not just top-line revenue"

### What NOT to Say

| Avoid | Why | Say Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| "We'll handle everything" | Sounds like overreach | "We'll focus on [specific scope]" |
| "This is easy" | Dismissive of their challenges | "We've solved this before" |
| "Your current tools are bad" | Defensive | "We complement what you have" |
| "6-8 weeks implementation" | May be unrealistic | "Let's scope it; typically 4-8 weeks depending on complexity" |
