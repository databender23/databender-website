# Scale-Up Manufacturer Data Partnership

## Who We Serve

**Scale-up manufacturers**—companies 10-20 years old, $15M-$75M in revenue—often PE-backed, recently acquired, or founder-led. Midwest preferred, but we work nationally via remote delivery.

These companies share a common challenge: **operations have outpaced their data infrastructure.** They have Salesforce, spreadsheets, inventory systems, and operational tools—but nothing that ties it together. Leadership wants dashboards and insights, investors want reporting, and the internal team is stretched too thin to build it.

**Note:** Don't over-qualify on growth rate (nearly impossible to verify for private companies). A stable $25M manufacturer with messy data is still a great prospect. "Recently acquired" is a better proxy for urgency than growth percentage.

## The Problem We Solve

### The Scale-Up Data Gap

Growing manufacturers face a painful reality:

**You have the tools.** Salesforce, QuickBooks, inventory management, scheduling systems, spreadsheets everywhere.

**You don't have the glue.** No unified view. No automated reporting. No way to answer "how's the business doing?" without someone spending a week pulling data.

**You're hiring to fix it.** But that IT Director or Data Manager you just brought on? They'll be onboarding, learning your systems, and putting out fires for the next 6-12 months before they deliver anything strategic.

**Meanwhile, growth won't wait.** Leads pile up. Opportunities slip through. Investors ask questions you can't answer. Decisions get made on gut feel instead of data.

### The Hiring Slowdown

We've seen this pattern repeatedly:

| Timeline | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Month 0 | "We need to hire a data person" |
| Month 1-3 | Searching, interviewing, negotiating |
| Month 4 | New hire starts |
| Month 5-6 | Onboarding, learning systems, getting access |
| Month 7-9 | First projects attempted (learning curve) |
| Month 10-12 | Finally becoming productive |
| Month 12+ | Actually delivering strategic value |

**Total time to impact: 12+ months.**

Meanwhile, the problems that drove the hire keep compounding.

## Our Role: Bridge the Gap

We're not here to replace your internal team. We're here to **bridge the gap while you build it.**

## What We Build

### Core Capability: Unified Data Infrastructure

Most scale-ups have data scattered across:
- **CRM** (Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics)
- **Accounting** (QuickBooks, NetSuite, Sage)
- **Inventory/ERP** (various systems)
- **Operations** (scheduling, logistics, production)
- **Spreadsheets** (everywhere, maintained by tribal knowledge)

We build the **data warehouse** that connects it all:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        DATA SOURCES                              │
│  Salesforce │ QuickBooks │ Inventory │ Scheduling │ Spreadsheets │
└──────┬──────┴─────┬──────┴─────┬─────┴──────┬─────┴──────┬───────┘
       │            │            │            │            │
       ▼            ▼            ▼            ▼            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     DATA WAREHOUSE                               │
│            (Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift)                   │
│         Unified, cleaned, modeled for your business             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS                          │
│  Dashboards │ Automated Reports │ Lead Scoring │ Forecasting    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** Ask any question about your business and get an answer in minutes, not weeks.

## Engagement Models

### Pricing Reality Check

A $25M manufacturer may not have $35K discretionary budget sitting around. Entry point matters—make it easy to say yes.

**Important:** The "$5K is often approved without CFO" assumption is optimistic. In founder-led companies especially, the founder approves everything over $1K. Build in risk reduction.

| Model | Investment | Purpose | Risk Reduction |
|-------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Free Data Audit | $0 (your time) | Prove value, build trust | No risk to prospect |
| Discovery Roadmap | $3,500 - $5,000 | Lowest friction paid entry | Credits toward next phase |
| Quick Win Sprint | $8,000 - $15,000 | Prove value fast | Specific deliverable guaranteed |
| Foundation Build | $35,000 - $60,000 | Full infrastructure | Phase or pay monthly |
| Fractional Data Team | $4,000 - $8,000/mo | Ongoing partnership | Month-to-month after 6 months |

---

### Model 0: Discovery Roadmap (Lowest Entry Point)

**For:** Companies who aren't ready to commit $8K+ but want clarity on what to do. Easiest "yes" to get.

**Scope:**
- 2-3 hour discovery session (systems inventory, pain points, priorities)
- Data landscape assessment (what connects to what, where the gaps are)
- Written roadmap: prioritized 90-day, 6-month, 12-month recommendations
- Rough budget estimates for each phase
- 30-minute presentation of findings

**Examples:**
- "We're not sure what we need—help us figure it out"
- "We want to hire a data person but don't know what to ask for"
- "Our PE firm wants a plan before approving budget"

**Investment:** $3,500 - $5,000

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**What you get:** A clear roadmap and budget you can take to leadership or investors. No commitment to implementation—but most clients continue because they now see the path clearly.

**Why this tier matters:**
- $5K is often within a manager's approval authority (no CFO needed)
- Removes "we're not ready" objection—this IS the readiness step
- Creates natural upsell to Quick Win Sprint or Foundation Build
- Differentiates from competitors who only sell big projects

---

### Model 1: Quick Win Sprint

**For:** Urgent problems that can't wait. Prove the partnership before committing further.

**Scope:**
- Single focused deliverable (dashboard, automation, integration)
- 3-4 week timeline
- Minimal discovery—we move fast
- Handoff with documentation

**Examples:**
- "We need a sales pipeline dashboard for our board meeting in 6 weeks"
- "Our reps are drowning in leads—help us prioritize"
- "We need to connect Salesforce to our inventory system"

**Investment:** $8,000 - $15,000

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks

**What you get:** One specific problem solved, fast. A chance to see how we work before going bigger.

---

### Model 2: Foundation Build

**For:** Companies ready to build proper data infrastructure. Often follows a successful Quick Win Sprint or Discovery Roadmap.

**Scope:**
- Data warehouse implementation (Snowflake, BigQuery, or similar)
- 3-5 data source integrations
- Core business dashboards (sales, operations, finance)
- Documentation and training for your team
- 30 days post-launch support

**Examples:**
- "We need all our data in one place"
- "Leadership wants a real-time view of the business"
- "Our new IT Director needs a foundation to build on"

**Investment:** $35,000 - $60,000

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

**Alternative framing (if $35K feels too big):**
- Monthly: "$12K/month for 3-4 months" sounds more digestible than "$45K project"
- Phase it: "Start with a $15K Quick Win Sprint, then decide on Foundation Build"
- ROI-linked: "This saves 20 hours/week × $50/hour = $52K/year. Pays for itself in under a year."

**What you get:** A modern data foundation your internal team can maintain and extend. The infrastructure that should have been built years ago—delivered in months.

---

### Model 3: Fractional Data Team

**For:** Companies who need ongoing data support while building internal capability—or who prefer to keep data outsourced indefinitely.

**Scope:**
- Dedicated hours per month (typically 20-40 hours)
- Ongoing development, maintenance, and optimization
- New dashboards and reports as needs evolve
- Support for your internal team
- Quarterly business reviews
- Priority response time

**Examples:**
- "We hired a Data Manager but they need senior support"
- "We don't want to hire a full data team—we'd rather outsource this"
- "Things keep changing as we grow—we need flexibility"

**Investment:** $4,000 - $8,000/month

**Commitment:** 6-month minimum, then month-to-month

**What you get:** A data team without the headcount. We handle the technical work; your people focus on using the insights.

## Why Databender

### Built for Scale-Ups

We work exclusively with growing mid-market companies. We understand:
- The pressure to move fast with limited resources
- Investors asking for reports you can't produce
- Systems that worked at $10M breaking at $30M
- The hiring slowdown when you bring on internal staff

### Full-Stack Capability

We're not specialists in one tool. We build the whole stack:
- **Data engineering:** Pipelines, warehouses, integrations
- **Analytics:** Dashboards, reports, KPIs
- **Data science:** Scoring models, forecasting, optimization
- **Automation:** Workflows, alerts, scheduled processes

One partner for all your data needs—not five vendors who don't talk to each other.

### Speed to Value

| Typical Timeline | Our Timeline |
|------------------|--------------|
| 6 months to hire | We start next week |
| 12 months to first deliverable | First deliverable in 4 weeks |
| 18 months to real value | Real value in 8-12 weeks |

### Handoff-Ready

We're not trying to create dependency. Every engagement includes:
- Full documentation
- Training for your team
- Clean, maintainable code
- Smooth transition to internal ownership

When your team is ready to own it, we step back. Until then, we keep things moving.

### Midwest Roots

Based in Chicago, working with Midwest manufacturers. We can be on-site when it matters. We understand companies that build things, not just software.

## The Decision

Your real options:

| Option | Timeline to Value | Cost (Year 1) | Risk |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|------|
| **Hire full-time data person** | 12-18 months | $150K+ (salary, benefits, tools) | Hire might not work out; long ramp |
| **Wait for bandwidth** | Never | Hidden (missed opportunities) | Fall further behind |
| **Start with Discovery Roadmap** | 1-2 weeks | $3.5K-$5K | Minimal—get clarity, then decide |
| **Engage for Foundation Build** | 8-12 weeks | $35K-$60K | Low—short engagement, clear deliverable |

**If budget is a concern:**
- Start with the $5K Discovery Roadmap—often approved without CFO involvement
- Use the roadmap to build the business case for Foundation Build
- Or phase it: Quick Win Sprint → Foundation Build over 4-6 months

**The math:** A full-time hire costs $150K+/year and takes 12+ months to deliver. We can build your foundation for less than half that cost in a quarter of the time—and hand it off to that hire when they're ready to maintain it.

---

## Common Questions

**"We just hired an IT Director / Data Manager. Should we still engage you?"**

Absolutely—this is the perfect time. Your new hire is going to be underwater for the next 6 months: onboarding, learning systems, putting out fires, sitting in meetings. The worst thing you can do is pile strategic projects on them right now. Let us build the foundation while they get oriented. When they're ready, they inherit clean systems instead of starting from scratch.

**"We're not sure what we need yet."**

Start with a Quick Win Sprint. Pick one problem—the dashboard your board keeps asking for, the lead prioritization your sales team needs, the integration that would save 10 hours a week. We'll solve it in 4 weeks. You'll see how we work, and we'll learn your business. Then we can talk about what's next.

**"What if our data is a mess?"**

It probably is. That's normal for companies at your stage. We've built pipelines that pull from 15 different spreadsheets maintained by 5 different people. We know how to work with imperfect data and improve it over time. The goal isn't perfect data—it's useful data.

**"How do you work with our existing tools?**

We integrate with whatever you have. Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, NetSuite, custom systems, spreadsheets—we've connected them all. We're not going to tell you to rip out your CRM. We build on top of what exists.

**"What happens when the engagement ends?"**

You own everything we build. Full documentation, training for your team, clean handoff. Our goal is to make ourselves unnecessary—or to stay on as your fractional data team if that's what you prefer.

## Typical Engagement Paths

**Path A: Low-friction entry (recommended when budget is uncertain)**
```
Week 1:     Discovery call → Scope Discovery Roadmap ($5K)
Week 2-3:   Discovery Roadmap delivered (clarity on what to do)
Week 4:     Client takes roadmap to leadership/investors for approval
Week 5-8:   Quick Win Sprint or Foundation Build begins
```

**Path B: Direct to Quick Win (when there's a clear urgent problem)**
```
Week 1:     Discovery call → Scope Quick Win Sprint
Week 2-5:   Quick Win Sprint delivered
Week 6:     Review results → Discuss Foundation Build
Week 7-18:  Foundation Build (data warehouse, dashboards, integrations)
Week 19+:   Option A: Handoff to internal team
            Option B: Transition to Fractional Data Team retainer
```

**Default starting point:**
- If they say "we're not sure what we need" → Discovery Roadmap
- If they say "we need X specific thing by Y date" → Quick Win Sprint
- If they say "we want to build our whole data infrastructure" → Foundation Build (but often better to start with Quick Win to prove the partnership)
