### Offering 6: Sales & Revenue Data Foundation

**The Problem**
Your sales team is scaling, but your CRM is a mess. Leads aren't scored consistently. Pipeline data is unreliable. Sales reps waste time on unqualified prospects while good leads slip through. You can't answer basic questions: What's our true conversion rate? Which lead sources perform best? What does a good prospect look like?

**The Solution**
Clean, reliable sales data infrastructure with lead scoring, pipeline analytics, and revenue visibility—so your sales team can focus on selling, not guessing.

**Who It's For**
- B2B scale-ups with growing sales teams (5+ reps)
- Companies where CRM data is inconsistent or incomplete
- Sales leaders who can't trust pipeline numbers
- PE portfolio companies needing revenue visibility and predictability
- Organizations that have outgrown "gut feel" selling

**The Pain Points We Solve**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| CRM data chaos | Duplicate contacts, incomplete records, inconsistent fields |
| No lead scoring | Reps treat all leads equally; waste time on bad fits |
| Pipeline unreliability | Forecasts are guesses; leadership can't plan |
| No conversion visibility | Don't know what's working or why deals stall |
| Manual reporting | Sales ops spends hours building reports instead of enabling sales |

**What We Build**

**CRM Data Foundation:**
- Data cleanup and deduplication (see AI-Powered Data Quality)
- Field standardization and validation rules
- Integration with marketing, support, and billing systems
- Single customer view across touchpoints

**Lead Scoring Model:**
- Analysis of historical wins/losses to identify patterns
- Scoring model based on firmographic, behavioral, and engagement signals
- Integration with CRM for automatic scoring
- Threshold recommendations for sales prioritization
- Ongoing refinement based on outcomes

**Pipeline Analytics:**
- Stage conversion rates and velocity metrics
- Pipeline coverage and forecast accuracy
- Rep performance dashboards
- Deal risk indicators
- Win/loss analysis

**Revenue Visibility:**
- Cohort analysis (LTV, retention by segment)
- Revenue attribution by source/campaign
- Customer health scoring (for expansion/churn prediction)

**What This Enables**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Reps guess at who to call | Reps prioritize high-score leads |
| Pipeline is a black box | Real-time visibility into coverage and risk |
| "We don't know our conversion rate" | Stage-by-stage metrics with trends |
| Forecasts are gut feel | Data-backed forecasting with accuracy tracking |

### Offering 7: AI-Powered Data Quality at Scale

**The Problem**
Your data has quality issues—duplicates, inconsistent formats, outdated information, mismatched records. Traditional cleanup is either too dumb (rules miss edge cases) or too expensive (manual review doesn't scale).

**The Solution**
AI agents that reason through data quality issues at scale—combining human judgment with automation throughput.

**Who It's For**
- Companies with large datasets and quality issues (10K+ records)
- Organizations where rules-based cleanup has failed
- Teams facing data migration with legacy quality problems
- Businesses where manual review would be cost-prohibitive
- Sales teams with CRM data chaos

**Why This Is Different**

| Traditional Approach | Agentic Approach |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Rules break on edge cases | Reasons through ambiguity |
| Manual review doesn't scale | Processes millions of records |
| No documentation of decisions | Full audit trail with reasoning |
| Expensive for large datasets | Fraction of manual cost |

**Common Use Cases**
- Entity resolution (is "John Smith" = "J. Smith"?)
- CRM deduplication and contact merging
- Account/contact matching across systems
- Lead-to-account matching
- ID reassignment (fixing broken record linkages)
- Address/name standardization at scale
- Data classification requiring judgment
- Legacy cleanup for migration projects

**Pricing**

| Scope | Price | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Proof of concept / pilot | $5,000-15,000 | 1-2 weeks |
| Standard (10K-100K records) | $15,000-40,000 | 2-6 weeks |
| Large (100K-1M records) | $40,000-100,000 | 4-10 weeks |
| Enterprise (1M+ records) | $100,000+ | 8-16 weeks |

**See `agentic-data-quality.md` for detailed methodology.**

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based, Not Time-Based
We price based on the value delivered, not just hours worked. Infrastructure that saves 20 hours/week is worth more than the hours it took to build.

### Factors That Affect Price
- **Complexity:** Number of systems, data quality, custom logic
- **Impact:** High-value problem = higher price
- **Timeline:** Rush work costs more
- **Scope:** More deliverables = higher investment
- **Ongoing needs:** Support adds to total investment

### What You Get for the Investment

| Investment Level | Typical Outcomes |
|------------------|------------------|
| $5K-15K | Single problem solved, quick win, assessment |
| $15K-40K | Core infrastructure built, major process automated, lead scoring foundation |
| $40K-75K | Full data infrastructure, multiple systems integrated, revenue analytics |
| $75K+ | Enterprise-grade implementation, ongoing partnership |

---

## When to Refer Out

Not every project is right for us. Refer when:

- **Need is purely IT support/help desk** - We're strategic, not break-fix
- **Need is a specific off-the-shelf product** - We implement, we don't resell
- **Budget is far below minimum** - Better served by freelancer or DIY
- **Need is outside our expertise** - Cybersecurity, app development, etc.
- **Red flags on client fit** - Communication issues, unrealistic expectations
- **Need is pure market research** - Better served by research firms

**It's okay to say:** "This isn't quite our sweet spot. Let me suggest [alternative] who might be better suited."
