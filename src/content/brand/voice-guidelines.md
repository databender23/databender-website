# Voice & Tone Guidelines

Standards for how Databender communicates across all channels.

---

## Brand Personality Traits

- **Knowledgeable but not condescending** - We know our stuff, but we explain it in ways that make sense
- **Professional but personable** - We're serious about quality work, but not stiff or corporate
- **Confident but humble** - We'll tell you what we're great at, and we'll tell you when something isn't our strength
- **Practical above all** - We care more about solving your problem than showcasing technical wizardry

---

## Voice Guidelines

### Do:
- Use clear, direct language
- Explain technical concepts with relevant analogies
- Be specific about outcomes and benefits
- Acknowledge complexity while making it approachable
- Show genuine curiosity about client challenges
- Use "we" for the company, feel free to use "I" when it's clearly founder-speaking contexts

### Don't:
- Use jargon for its own sake
- Oversimplify to the point of being inaccurate
- Sound like a corporate press release
- Promise transformation without substance
- Use buzzwords without meaning (synergy, leverage, paradigm shift)
- Be overly casual or try too hard to be cool
