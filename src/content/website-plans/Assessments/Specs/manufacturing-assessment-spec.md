**Assessment Name**: Sales Pipeline Health Check

**Target Audience**: Manufacturing sales leaders (VP Sales, Sales Directors, Sales Ops), particularly companies in the $10M-$200M revenue range

### Benchmark Comparison

> "Your score: **[XX]**. Average for manufacturing companies: **62**."

*Note: Use industry benchmark data if available; otherwise use a reasonable estimate and refine as data accumulates.*

> "Companies with scores above 70 typically see **25% higher conversion rates** than those below 50."

---

### Personalized Insights (Dynamic Based on Answers)

**Display 2-3 relevant insights based on lowest-scoring areas:**

**If low data completeness (Q8 or Q9 < 50%):**
> "With less than 50% of leads having complete firmographic data, any lead scoring model will be guessing. Data enrichment is a prerequisite for accurate prioritization."

**If no engagement tracking (Q11 = No):**
> "You're missing behavioral signals—website visits, email engagement—that are often the strongest predictors of conversion. Integrating marketing data would significantly improve scoring accuracy."

**If rep judgment prioritization (Q13 = Rep judgment):**
> "Rep intuition has value, but it doesn't scale and isn't consistent. Companies that implement lead scoring typically see 15-30% improvement in conversion rates."

**If limited historical data (Q12 < 1 year):**
> "Lead scoring models learn from past outcomes. With less than a year of win/loss data, we'd need to start with rule-based scoring and evolve to ML as data accumulates."

**If no CRM (Q7 = No CRM):**
> "Without a CRM, there's no foundation for lead scoring. A CRM is the essential first step—even a basic implementation would transform your ability to prioritize leads."

**If poor stage tracking (Q15 = Don't track):**
> "Not knowing your conversion rates at each stage means you can't identify where deals are getting stuck. This visibility is foundational for any pipeline optimization."

---

### Conversion Impact Estimate

**Formula**:
```
Impact = [Annual Pipeline Value] × [Estimated Conversion Improvement]
```

**Calculation based on inputs**:
```
Estimated Annual Pipeline = [Deal Size Midpoint] × [Deals/Year Estimate based on team size]
Conservative Improvement = 15% (for scoring implementation)
```

**Display**:
> "If lead scoring improved your conversion rate by just 15% on your current pipeline, that would mean approximately **$[calculated amount]** in additional revenue annually."

**Example**:
- $100K average deal × 50 deals/year × 25% current close rate = $1.25M current revenue
- 15% improvement = ~$190K additional revenue

---

### Recommendations Section

**For High Scores (80+)**:
> "Your data infrastructure and processes are well-positioned for advanced lead scoring. The opportunity now is building custom models that go beyond generic CRM scoring—integrating all your data sources and ensuring the model explains its reasoning so reps trust and use it."

**For Good Scores (60-79)**:
> "You have a solid foundation. Addressing your [weakest category] would unlock significant value. With your existing data, a custom lead scoring model could start delivering results within weeks."

**For Developing Scores (40-59)**:
> "Core elements are in place, but gaps in [weakest area] would limit scoring effectiveness. A phased approach—improving data quality first, then implementing scoring—would deliver the best results."

**For Early Stage (<40)**:
> "There's significant opportunity to improve, but foundational work comes first. We'd recommend starting with CRM optimization and data hygiene before investing in scoring models."

### Body Copy

> In manufacturing sales, every lead represents significant potential value—but not every lead deserves the same attention.
>
> The challenge? Most sales teams lack the data infrastructure and tools to know which leads are most likely to close. Reps rely on gut feel. Good opportunities slip through the cracks. Bad-fit prospects consume valuable time.
>
> Lead scoring solves this—but only if it's built on clean data and designed for adoption.
>
> This assessment evaluates your CRM data quality, sales processes, and readiness for data-driven prioritization. In 5 minutes, you'll know exactly where you stand and what's possible.
