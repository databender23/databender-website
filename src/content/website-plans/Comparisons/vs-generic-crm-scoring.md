# Comparison: Custom ML Scoring vs. Generic CRM Scoring

**URL:** `/compare/custom-vs-generic-lead-scoring/`

**Page Title:** Custom ML Lead Scoring vs. Generic CRM Rules | Databender

**Meta Description:** Generic CRM scoring uses industry averages. Custom ML discovers what actually predicts conversion in YOUR business—and finds 21% more qualified leads.

---

## Purpose

This page helps prospects understand why custom ML scoring outperforms generic CRM scoring. Target audience:
- Companies frustrated with inaccurate CRM lead scores
- Sales leaders whose reps ignore lead scores
- Companies considering predictive analytics investments
- Businesses who've tried scoring tools and been disappointed

---

## Hero Section

### Headline
**"Generic tools said home value mattered most. Our model discovered what actually predicts conversions."**

### Subheadline
Off-the-shelf scoring uses industry averages. Custom ML models discover the signals unique to YOUR business—and explain every score so reps actually trust them.

### Proof Point
> *Real project: +21% more high-priority leads identified. Custom model found signals generic tools can't see.*

## The Comparison

### Headline
**"Same leads. Different priorities. Better results."**

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Factor | Generic CRM Scoring | Custom ML Scoring |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Data source** | Industry averages | YOUR wins/losses |
| **Signals used** | Standard demographics | Custom features + external data |
| **Adaptability** | Same rules for everyone | Tailored to your buyers |
| **Unique signals** | Can't find them | Discovers your specific patterns |
| **Explainability** | Black box or basic | "Why this score?" on every lead |
| **Improvement** | Static rules | Learns from new outcomes |
| **Integration** | Out-of-box | Custom to your workflow |
| **Scoring speed** | Varies | <30 seconds, real-time |

## Why Generic Scoring Fails

### Headline
**"Industry averages don't know your customers"**

### Problem 1: Wrong Signals Weighted
Generic tools use signals that work "on average" across industries:

| Generic Assumption | Reality (One Example) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| "Home value predicts premium purchases" | Home EQUITY matters more (+1.12 vs +0.04) |
| "Demographics are primary" | Company's own sales history matters more |
| "Same rules work everywhere" | Every business has unique buyer patterns |

### Problem 2: Missing Your Unique Signals
Some of the most predictive signals are impossible for generic tools to see:
- **Your past sales by geography** — Where you've won before
- **Your specific buyer patterns** — What makes YOUR customers different
- **Your timeline urgency factors** — How YOUR buyers express intent

Example: One company discovered that past sales in a ZIP code was the 3rd strongest predictor. Generic tools can't even access this data.

### Problem 3: Reps Don't Trust Black Boxes
When scores have no explanation:
- **Reps ignore them** — "The system says 80, but I don't believe it"
- **No learning** — Reps can't understand what drives success
- **No accountability** — Can't tell if scoring is working

### Problem 4: One-Size-Fits-None
Generic scoring treats every business the same:
- **Luxury product vs. commodity** — Different buyer signals
- **B2B vs. B2C** — Different decision factors
- **Regional vs. national** — Different geographic patterns

## How Custom ML Scoring Works

### Headline
**"Built on your data. Explains every decision."**

### The Process

```
1. HISTORICAL ANALYSIS
   ↓ Analyze 2+ years of your wins and losses

2. FEATURE DISCOVERY
   ↓ Identify what actually predicts conversion in YOUR business

3. EXTERNAL ENRICHMENT
   ↓ Add property, census, and other relevant data

4. MODEL TRAINING
   ↓ Build custom ML model on your specific patterns

5. REAL-TIME SCORING
   ↓ Every new lead scored in <30 seconds

6. EXPLAINABLE OUTPUT
   ↓ "Why this score?" visible on every lead
```

### What Reps Actually See

```
LEAD: John Smith
SCORE: 87/100 (High Priority)

WHY THIS SCORE:
• High home equity (+32 points)
• Immediate project timeline (+28 points)
• 3 past sales in this ZIP (+11 points)
• Large home (3,200 sq ft) (+8 points)

RECOMMENDATION: Call within 24 hours
```

Reps understand the logic. They trust the scores. They use them.

## Real Project Results

### Headline
**"What custom scoring discovered"**

### Case Study: Premium Roofing Lead Scoring

**The Challenge:**
- Premium product with specific buyer profile
- Generic CRM scoring wasn't working—reps ignored it
- High lead volume, no way to prioritize
- Hot leads going cold while reps chased unlikely buyers

**What Generic Tools Said:**
- Home value is the primary signal
- Standard demographics define buyers
- Same rules as every other company

**What Our Custom Model Discovered:**

| Feature | Generic Importance | Actual Importance |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Home Value | Primary signal | Nearly irrelevant (+0.04) |
| Home Equity | Not used | Strongest predictor (+1.12) |
| Project Timeline | Basic weight | Second strongest (+0.98) |
| Past Sales in ZIP | Not possible | Strong signal (+0.39) |
| Square Footage | Basic weight | Better than home value (+0.28) |

**The Results:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| High-priority lead identification | Baseline | +21% |
| Additional qualified leads/month | — | +754 |
| Scoring latency | Manual lookup | <30 seconds |
| Rep trust in scores | Low (ignored) | High (used daily) |

**Business Impact:**
- Reps call high-priority leads within hours, not days
- Hot leads no longer go cold
- Sales efficiency dramatically improved
- Data-driven prioritization at scale

## Feature Importance: Generic vs. Custom

### Headline
**"What generic tools miss"**

### Real Coefficient Comparison

From the lead scoring case study:

| Rank | Feature | Custom Model Coefficient | Generic Tool Weight |
|------|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Home Equity | +1.12 | Not used |
| 2 | Project Timeline | +0.98 | Low/medium |
| 3 | Past Sales in ZIP | +0.39 | Not possible |
| 4 | Square Footage | +0.28 | Low |
| 5 | Home Value | +0.04 | High (wrong!) |

**Key Insight:** The signal generic tools weight most heavily (home value) is nearly irrelevant for this business. Custom models find what actually matters.

## When Each Approach Makes Sense

### Headline
**"Honest assessment"**

### Generic Scoring May Be Right If:
- You have minimal historical data (<6 months)
- Your business is truly commodity/undifferentiated
- You just need "something" quickly
- Budget constraints are severe

### Custom ML Scoring Is Better If:
- You have 12+ months of win/loss data
- Your buyers have unique characteristics
- Reps currently ignore your lead scores
- You suspect you're missing high-priority leads
- Explainability matters (reps need to trust scores)
- You want scores to improve over time
- You're investing in sales efficiency

---

## FAQ

**Q: How much historical data do we need?**
A: Ideally 12-24 months of win/loss data. More is better, but we can work with what you have and improve as data accumulates.

**Q: What if our CRM data is messy?**
A: We often combine this with data cleanup work. Clean data makes better predictions. We can assess your data quality first.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Typically 4-6 weeks from kickoff to production scoring. This includes data analysis, model development, and Salesforce integration.

**Q: Will reps actually use the scores?**
A: The "why this score?" explanation is key. Reps trust scores they understand. Our models explain every prediction.

**Q: How do scores improve over time?**
A: As new deals close (or lose), the model can be retrained on fresh data. Patterns shift; the model adapts.

**Q: What about deals that don't fit the pattern?**
A: No model is perfect. But catching 21% more high-priority leads means reps focus on better opportunities overall.
