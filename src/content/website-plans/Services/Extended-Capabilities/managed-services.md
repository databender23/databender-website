## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Built it. Now what?"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **No one to maintain** | You have dashboards, pipelines, and reports. Who keeps them running? |
| **Can't justify headcount** | Full-time data engineer is $150K+/year. You don't need someone 40 hours/week. |
| **Things break** | Pipelines fail. Sources change. Dashboards go stale. |
| **New requests pile up** | Business needs evolve faster than you can build. |
| **Tribal knowledge** | The person who built it left. Now no one knows how it works. |

### What You Need
- Reliable maintenance
- Responsive support
- Ongoing development capacity
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

## FAQ Section

**Q: What's the minimum commitment?**
A: 6-month initial term, then month-to-month. This gives us time to learn your systems and provide real value.

**Q: Can we change tiers?**
A: Yes. You can scale up or down with 30 days notice.

**Q: What if we need a big project done?**
