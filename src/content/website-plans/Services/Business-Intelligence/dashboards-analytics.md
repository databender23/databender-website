## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"You're flying blind"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **Reports are stale** | By the time you get the monthly report, the month is over. |
| **Can't self-serve** | Want to know something? Put in a request and wait. |
| **Too many dashboards** | You have 50 dashboards. None answer your question. |
| **Numbers don't match** | Finance says one thing. Sales says another. Who's right? |
| **Buried in spreadsheets** | Every analysis starts with Excel exports and manual work. |

### What Good Looks Like
- Real-time visibility into key metrics
- Self-service access to the data you need
- Single source of truth everyone trusts
- Dashboards designed for your actual questions

## How It Works Section

### Headline
**"Built for how you work"**

### Process

**Step 1: Discovery**
What questions do you need to answer? What decisions do you make? What metrics matter?

**Step 2: Data**
Where does the data live? Is it connected? Is it clean? (If not, we fix that first.)

**Step 3: Design**
We design dashboards around your questions, your workflow, your decisions.

**Step 4: Build**
We build in your BI tool of choice—Tableau, Looker, Power BI, or others.

**Step 5: Refine**
After launch, we iterate based on how you actually use them.
