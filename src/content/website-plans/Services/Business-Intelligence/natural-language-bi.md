## Why This Is a Flagship

## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"The report request bottleneck"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **Can't answer your own questions** | You have a question. You ask IT or your analyst. They add it to the queue. You wait days or weeks. |
| **Dashboard overload** | You have 47 dashboards. None of them answer the question you have right now. |
| **SQL is a barrier** | The data exists. You just can't get to it without knowing a programming language. |
| **Context gets lost** | You ask "how are we doing?" and get "what do you mean by 'doing'?" |

### The Cost
- Decisions delayed while waiting for data
- Analysts overwhelmed with ad-hoc requests
- Executives flying blind between reporting cycles
- Questions go unasked because it's too much effort

---

## How It Works Section

### Headline
**"Ask questions like you'd ask a colleague"**

### Example Questions

| What You Ask | What You Get |
|--------------|--------------|
| "How did we do last month?" | Revenue, margins, key metrics—with comparison to prior periods |
| "Which customers are at risk?" | List of accounts showing warning signs, ranked by revenue impact |
| "What's driving the increase in returns?" | Analysis by product, region, and time—highlighting root causes |
| "Show me sales by rep this quarter" | Ranked performance with trends and comparisons |

### How It Actually Works

**Step 1: Foundation First**
We connect your data sources and build a clean, unified foundation. This is why our answers are accurate—the data underneath is trustworthy.

**Step 2: Business Context**
We teach the system your business language. What does "customer" mean? How do you calculate margins? What are your KPIs?

**Step 3: Natural Interface**
You ask questions in plain English. The system translates to queries, gets the data, and responds with answers and visualizations.

**Step 4: Learning**
The more you use it, the better it gets. It learns your common questions, your preferences, your business patterns.

## Why Most "Ask Your Data" Tools Fail Section

| Common Problem | Our Approach |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Wrong answers** | We build the data foundation first. Garbage in, garbage out—so we fix the input. |

## FAQ Section

**Q: How accurate are the answers?**
A: Accuracy depends on data quality. That's why we focus on building a solid foundation first. With clean, well-modeled data, accuracy is excellent. We also provide audit trails so you can verify any answer.

**Q: Can it handle sensitive data?**
A: Yes. We build with security and compliance in mind. Role-based access ensures people only see data they're authorized to see.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: If your data foundation is already solid: 4-6 weeks. If we need to build the foundation first: 8-12 weeks total.

**Q: What if it can't answer a question?**
A: The system will tell you when it can't answer confidently, rather than guessing. We can then add the capability for that type of question.

**Q: Is this ChatGPT?**
A: No. ChatGPT is a general AI that doesn't know your data. Our Natural Language BI is trained on your specific business data and context—so it actually knows the answers.
