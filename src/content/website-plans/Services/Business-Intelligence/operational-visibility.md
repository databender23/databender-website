### Process

**Step 1: Map Operations**
We document your operational processes. What happens? What matters? Where are the blind spots?

**Step 2: Identify Data Sources**
Where does operational data live? Systems, sensors, logs, manual inputs?

**Step 3: Build Connections**
Connect data sources to enable real-time (or near real-time) visibility.

**Step 4: Design Views**
Create operational dashboards tailored to different roles—floor managers, executives, analysts.

**Step 5: Enable Alerts**
Configure notifications for exceptions, thresholds, and anomalies.
