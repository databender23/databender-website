## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Your data is everywhere except where you need it"**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **Systems don't talk** | Salesforce doesn't know what QuickBooks knows. Neither knows what's in your spreadsheets. |
| **Manual data transfers** | Someone is copying data from one system to another. Every week. Introducing errors. |
| **No unified view** | Want to see revenue by customer? That requires data from three different systems. |
| **Report chaos** | Every report is a project. Pull from here, export from there, combine in Excel, pray it's accurate. |

### The Cost
- Hours spent on manual data work
- Decisions made with incomplete information
- Errors introduced through manual transfers
- Opportunities missed because the data wasn't connected

## What We Connect Section

### Headline
**"We work with what you have"**

### Common Systems

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **CRM** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics 365, Pipedrive |
| **Accounting** | QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Sage |
| **Operations** | Custom systems, scheduling tools, inventory management |

### What If My System Isn't Listed?
We've connected hundreds of different systems. If it stores data, we can probably connect it. If you have a legacy or custom system, we'll figure it out.

## How It Works Section

### Headline
**"From scattered to unified"**

### Process

**Step 1: Inventory**
We map all your data sources. What systems do you use? What data lives where? What needs to connect?

**Step 2: Design**
We design the data model. How should data flow? What's the source of truth for each entity? How do records connect across systems?

**Step 3: Build**
We build the pipelines that move data from your systems to a central location—typically a modern cloud data warehouse.

**Step 4: Automate**
Data flows automatically. No manual exports. No copy-paste. Fresh data, every day (or more frequently if needed).
