---

## Hero Section

### Headline
**"Everything you need to turn data into results"**

### Subheadline
From cleaning up scattered systems to AI that works—we build complete solutions, not pieces.

### Visual
Three connected pillars showing progression:
```
DATA MANAGEMENT → BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE → AI & AUTOMATION
   (Foundation)        (Visibility)          (Intelligence)
```

---

## Three Pillars Overview

### How to Present

Each pillar gets equal treatment. Show them as connected stages of a journey:

| Pillar | Position | Message |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Data Management** | "Start here" | Clean, connected data is the foundation. Without it, nothing else works. |
| **Business Intelligence** | "See clearly" | Once your data is ready, you can finally see what's happening across your business. |
| **AI & Automation** | "Work smarter" | With clean data and clear visibility, AI can actually deliver on its promises. |

---

## Pillar 1: Data Management

### Section Headline
**"Get your data in order"**

### Description
Your systems don't talk to each other. Records are duplicated, outdated, or just wrong. You spend more time wrestling with data than using it.

We fix that. We connect your systems, clean your data, and build a foundation you can trust.

### Services in This Pillar

| Service | One-liner | Link |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Data Integration** | Connect all your systems into one unified view | `/services/data-integration/` |
| **AI-Powered Data Cleanup** ★ | Intelligent data cleaning that improves over time | `/services/ai-data-cleanup/` |
| **Data Foundation** | Build the infrastructure for everything else | `/services/data-foundation/` |

★ = Flagship service (unique differentiator)

## Pillar 2: Business Intelligence

### Section Headline
**"See what's happening"**

### Description
You shouldn't have to ask someone to pull a report. You shouldn't wait until month-end to know how you're doing. You should be able to ask a question and get an answer.

We build dashboards and reports that give you visibility into your whole operation—in real time.

### Services in This Pillar

| Service | One-liner | Link |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Dashboards & Analytics** | Visual dashboards that answer your real questions | `/services/dashboards-analytics/` |

## Pillar 3: AI & Automation

### Section Headline
**"Work smarter with AI"**

### Description
AI isn't magic—it's only as good as the data underneath it. That's why most AI projects fail. We build AI that works because we build the foundation first.

From automated insights to predictive analytics, we put intelligence where it actually helps.

### Services in This Pillar

| Service | One-liner | Link |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **AI-Generated Insights** ★ | Automated analysis that surfaces what matters | `/services/ai-insights/` |
