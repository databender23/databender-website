## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"You've outgrown your data infrastructure"**

### The Scale-Up Challenge
> You've grown from $10M to $30M. The systems that worked at $10M are breaking at $30M.
>
> Your sales data is in Salesforce. Financial data is in QuickBooks. Inventory is in... somewhere. Operations has their own spreadsheets.
>
> Leadership wants a dashboard. Investors want reports. You want to use AI. But you can't do any of it because your data is scattered everywhere.

### Pain Points

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Systems don't connect** | Salesforce doesn't know what inventory knows |
| **No unified view** | "How's the business doing?" takes a week to answer |
| **Reporting is manual** | Every report is an export-combine-format project |
| **Can't trust the numbers** | Different systems show different answers |
| **No foundation for AI** | Want to use AI, but data isn't ready |

### The Hiring Slowdown
You just hired an IT Director or Data Manager. Great. But they'll be onboarding, learning systems, and putting out fires for 6-12 months before they deliver anything strategic. You need results sooner.

## Engagement Options Section

### Headline
**"Start where you are"**

| Option | Investment | What You Get | Timeline |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Discovery Roadmap** | $3.5K - $5K | Clear plan, budget estimates, priorities | 1-2 weeks |
| **Quick Win Sprint** | $8K - $15K | One specific problem solved fast | 3-4 weeks |
| **Foundation Build** | $35K - $60K | Complete data infrastructure | 8-12 weeks |
| **Fractional Data Team** | $4K - $8K/mo | Ongoing support, maintenance, development | Ongoing |

## The Math Section

### Headline
**"Better than hiring (at first)"**

| Full-Time Hire | Databender |
|----------------|------------|
| $150K+/year loaded cost | $35K-$60K for foundation |
| 12+ months to first strategic value | First deliverable in 4 weeks |
| Single point of failure | Team with backup |
| Ramp-up time to learn your systems | We've done this before |

### The Ideal Path
1. **We build the foundation** (8-12 weeks)
2. **Your hire comes on board** (parallel)
3. **We hand off clean systems** (documented, maintainable)
4. **Your team maintains and extends** (or we continue as fractional team)

## FAQ Section

**Q: We just hired an IT Director. Should we still engage you?**
A: Absolutely. Your new hire will be underwater for 6 months learning systems and putting out fires. We build the foundation while they get oriented. When they're ready, they inherit clean systems instead of starting from scratch.

**Q: What if our data is a mess?**
A: It probably is. We've built pipelines pulling from 15 different spreadsheets maintained by 5 different people. We know how to work with imperfect data and improve it over time.

**Q: Do you work with Midwest manufacturers?**
A: Yes. We're Chicago-based and work extensively with Midwest manufacturing companies. We can be on-site when it matters.

**Q: What happens when you're done?**
A: You own everything we build. Full documentation, training, clean handoff. You can maintain it internally or keep us on as your fractional data team.
