## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"Every property is an island"**

### The Reality
> You manage 25 properties. 10 are on Yardi. 8 are on AppFolio. 5 are on MRI. 2 are on something else entirely.
>
> Want to know portfolio occupancy? That's 4 different systems, 4 different logins, 4 different export formats, and a spreadsheet to combine them.
>
> Want to catch a lease renewal before it's too late? Good luck—each property tracks their own.

### Pain Points

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **No unified portfolio view** | Can't see occupancy, NOI, performance across all properties |
| **Reporting takes weeks** | Manual consolidation for every investor/owner report |
| **Lease renewals slip** | No centralized view of upcoming expirations |
| **Can't compare properties** | Different systems, different metrics, apples to oranges |
| **Acquisitions add complexity** | Every new property brings another system |
