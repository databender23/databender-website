## The Problem Section

### Headline
**"The knowledge problem every firm faces"**

### Scenario
> A partner asks an associate to draft a licensing agreement for a pharmaceutical client. The associate:
>
> 1. Asks around—"has anyone done pharma licensing?"
> 2. Searches the document management system (gets 2,000 results)
> 3. Emails a few partners (waits for responses)
> 4. Eventually starts drafting from a generic template
>
> **Meanwhile:** The firm has done 15 pharma licensing agreements. Two partners are recognized experts. There's a playbook from last year's similar deal.
>
> **The problem isn't that the knowledge doesn't exist. It's that no one can find it.**

### Pain Points

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Prior work is unfindable** | Associates waste hours reinventing what the firm already knows |
| **Expertise is invisible** | Partners don't know who has relevant experience for pitches |
| **Client history is fragmented** | Relationships live in individual partner's heads |
| **Onboarding takes forever** | New attorneys take years to learn what the firm knows |
| **Knowledge leaves with people** | When partners retire, decades of expertise disappear |
