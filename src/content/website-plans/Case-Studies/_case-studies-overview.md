### Featured Case Study 2: Firm Knowledge Platform

**Industry Tag:** Professional Services
**Service Tags:** Data Integration, Natural Language BI, AI

**What We Built:**
- AI-powered knowledge search across all documents
- Expertise discovery and mapping
- Natural language queries ("find examples of...")
- Secure, role-based access controls

**The Results:**

- Rep prioritization tools

**The Results:**
