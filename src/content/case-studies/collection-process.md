# Case Study & Testimonial Collection Process

## Overview

Social proof—case studies, testimonials, logos, and references—fuels all marketing and sales activities. This document outlines how to systematically collect and use these assets.

## Why This Matters

| Asset | Use Cases |
|-------|-----------|
| **Case studies** | Website, proposals, sales conversations, content marketing |
| **Testimonials** | Website, proposals, LinkedIn, email signatures |
| **Logos** | Website "clients" section, proposals, presentations |
| **References** | Sales process (prospect wants to talk to past client) |

Without intentional collection, these assets don't get captured. Collect while the project is fresh.

## Types of Social Proof

### 1. Case Studies (Detailed)
- **What**: 500-1000 word narrative of a successful engagement
- **Structure**: Situation → Approach → Results
- **Use**: Website, proposals, sales conversations, content marketing
- **Effort**: High (requires client involvement and approval)

### 2. Testimonials (Short Quotes)
- **What**: 1-3 sentence endorsement from a client
- **Use**: Website, proposals, LinkedIn, email
- **Effort**: Low-medium (quick ask, simple approval)

### 3. Logo Permission
- **What**: Permission to display client's logo
- **Use**: Website "clients" section, proposals, presentations
- **Effort**: Low (simple approval)

### 4. Reference Availability
- **What**: Client willing to take calls from prospects
- **Use**: Late-stage sales process
- **Effort**: Medium (relationship must be strong)

## When to Collect

### Best Timing

| Milestone | What to Ask For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Project completion** | Testimonial, logo permission, case study interest |
| **After positive feedback** | Testimonial (capture exact words) |
| **Results delivered** | Case study (concrete outcomes to feature) |
| **Quarterly check-in** | Reference availability |

### The Ask Sequence

1. **Project completion**: Ask for testimonial + logo permission
2. **If positive response**: Ask about case study interest
3. **If case study agreed**: Schedule interview, draft, get approval
4. **Ongoing relationship**: Confirm reference availability

## Collection Scripts

### Testimonial Request (Email)

```
Subject: Quick favor—would you be willing to share a brief testimonial?

Hi [Name],

I'm glad [project] delivered value for [Company]. As I continue to grow my practice, testimonials from clients like you make a real difference.

Would you be willing to share a brief testimonial (just 2-3 sentences) about your experience working with me? Something like what we worked on, what you valued about the engagement, or the results you saw.

If helpful, here's a starting point you could edit:

"We worked with Databender on [project type]. [What you valued—e.g., Their approach to X was Y]. [Outcome or recommendation—e.g., The project delivered Z and I'd recommend them to others facing similar challenges.]"

Of course, feel free to write your own or modify however you'd like. I'll send over the final version for your approval before using it anywhere.

Thanks so much,
[Name]
```

### Logo Permission Request (Email)

```
Subject: Quick request—logo permission

Hi [Name],

I'm updating my website and would love to include [Company] as a client I've worked with. Would you be comfortable with me displaying [Company]'s logo on my website in a "clients" section?

I won't make any specific claims about our work—just the logo to show who I've had the privilege of working with.

Let me know if that's okay or if you need to check with anyone internally.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### Case Study Request (Email)

```
Subject: Would you be open to being featured in a case study?

Hi [Name],

Our work on [project] delivered some great results, and I think it could make a compelling case study to help others facing similar challenges.

Would you be open to being featured? The process would be:
1. A brief interview (20-30 minutes) where I ask about the situation, what we did, and the results
2. I draft the case study
3. You review and approve before anything is published

It's a great way to showcase [Company]'s innovation, and I'd be happy to share the final piece for your own use as well.

Let me know if you're interested, and we can find a time.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### Reference Request (Verbal/Email)

```
Hi [Name],

From time to time, prospects in similar situations ask to speak with a past client before moving forward. Would you be comfortable being a reference for me?

It's not common—maybe 1-2 calls per year—and I'd always ask you first before sharing your contact info. The calls are usually 15-20 minutes where they ask about your experience working together.

No pressure if you'd prefer not to, but if you're open to it, it would be a huge help.

## Case Study Interview Guide

If client agrees to a case study, conduct a short interview:

### Interview Questions (20-30 min)

**The Situation**
1. "What was the situation or challenge before we started working together?"
2. "What had you tried before, if anything?"
3. "What was at stake if the problem wasn't solved?"

**The Approach**
4. "How did you find/choose to work with me?"
5. "What was the process like? What did we actually do?"
6. "What stood out about the approach or working relationship?"

**The Results**
7. "What were the results or outcomes?"
8. "Can you quantify any of the impact?" (Numbers are gold)
9. "What's different now compared to before?"

**The Takeaway**
10. "What would you tell someone considering similar work?"
11. "Would you recommend this to others? Why?"

### Tips for Good Interviews
- Record (with permission) so you capture exact quotes
- Listen more than you talk
- Follow up on interesting points
- Ask for specific numbers whenever possible

### Anonymized Case Studies

- Remove identifying details
- Keep outcomes and approach general enough
- Get approval even for anonymized version

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Client says "I'm too busy" | Offer to draft testimonial for them to edit |
| Client wants to stay anonymous | Anonymized case study or general testimonial |
| Legal/compliance concerns | Offer to get their legal team's input, be flexible |
| Can't quantify results | Focus on qualitative outcomes, process, relationship |
| No response to request | Follow up once, then let it go (don't damage relationship) |

---

## Legal Considerations

### What to Document
- Written approval for testimonials (email is fine)
- Written approval for case studies
- Written approval for logo use
- Any restrictions (e.g., "don't use on social media")

### What to Avoid
- Using social proof without permission
- Implying endorsement beyond what was agreed
- Making claims the client didn't verify
- Using outdated testimonials from people who've left
