With football season approaching, let&#8217;s explore our favorite data-driven draft strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This analysis helps you draft your team using the Value Over Replacement (VOR) approach. VOR measures the value a player adds compared to <em>the average player<\/em> at their position, revealing the true scarcity value of players across different positions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The VOR data is available in the app below.

The goal is to pick players that others undervalue and maximize potential upside for bench players while minimizing risk for starters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1600\/1*hgObKGXSPetLJDcPXgfSsQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill use \u201csabermetrics\u201d in Moneyball<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To accurately determine a player\u2019s value, we need to compare their projected points to the average player at the same position. We define an average player as: <em>the player whose rank at a position matches the average number of players chosen at that position by pick 100.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After calculating each player\u2019s value, we can compare it to the average value at their position to determine the VOR. You can find a more detailed explanation of the VOR calculation and all other metrics used in the app in the documentation for the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FantasyFootballAnalytics\/ffanalytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ffanalytics R package<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The VOR Insight: Quarterbacks Aren&#8217;t Everything<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VOR highlights the problem of focusing only on projected points when drafting. When looking at projected points, it is easy to think that a quarterback is the most valuable player. However, when we look at the <strong>2025 VOR rankings<\/strong>, the story changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Bijan Robinson (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 182.2<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Saquon Barkley (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 170.5<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 170.5<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ja&#8217;Marr Chase (WR)<\/strong> \u2014 158.3<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>De&#8217;Von Achane (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 148.1<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Christian McCaffrey (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 143.6<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Josh Jacobs (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 121.2<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Derrick Henry (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 120.7<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ashton Jeanty (RB)<\/strong> \u2014 119.8<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Justin Jefferson (WR)<\/strong> \u2014 119.0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concentration of value in elite running backs this year makes early draft strategy more critical than ever.

Access to immediate insights empowers informed decision-making, providing a competitive edge. One of our clients, a cryptocurrency trading firm, faced challenges managing their data, leading to issues in their automated trading system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Capturing data from external sources can be messy, especially when utilizing techniques like web scraping. However, this is sometimes the best option to capture data in real-time while minimizing costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve come across this situation many times. Websites change, scraper logic doesn\u2019t function properly, and the risk of data loss can be massive. In this situation, our client missed out on valuable trading opportunities &#8211; or, even worse, placing incorrect trades based on stale or invalid data. The data issues were so severe that operations were on the verge of being shut down to prevent further losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accurate data is vital to the performance of any data product. Luckily, safeguards can be implemented to help validate the data and ensure information is captured as accurately as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the best options for monitoring data in real-time?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The remainder of this article will summarize some ideas for handling situations like this and put your product in the best position for success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every situation is different, but to help frame this analysis, here is a breakdown of the requirements defined for this project:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Implement a monitoring tool that identifies data issues in real-time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create an alerting system that delivers messages via email and Slack to relevant stakeholders<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>User-friendly interface with intuitive features<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Visual-based analysis to allow efficient interpretation of data quality issues<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identification of problem areas in messages so issues can be addressed as quickly as possible and prevent downtime<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low-code\/no-code solution to allow non-technical users to work with the data and assist with troubleshooting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Option 1: Tableau Alerts &amp; Subscriptions\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tableau provides an easy-to-use interface that simplifies alert and subscription creation. Users can easily define conditions and triggers based on visualizations and data conditions through a visually configured setup. This accessibility makes Tableau&#8217;s alerting and subscription feature suitable for a diverse audience, catering to business users, analysts, and technical support teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below for a breakdown of the pros and cons of this tool:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Cons<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Simple setup of alerts through the Tableau interface.<\/td><td>The data must be delivered to Tableau in real time.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>There is no need to provision resources to implement the process &#8211; Tableau handles everything.<\/td><td>Data needs to be prepared in a format that is interpretable by Tableau.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The platform supports automated report delivery through subscriptions on a scheduled or event-driven basis.<\/td><td>Tableau development skills are required for initial setup and maintenance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Notifications can be delivered via Email or Slack.<\/td><td>Tableau subscription fees apply (not relevant if already using Tableau for other purposes).<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Option 2: Custom Python Scripts &amp; Advanced Analytics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Python scripts for data monitoring provide significant customization and flexibility, allowing developers to implement intricate logic and tailored calculations. The real-time data processing capabilities allow dynamic and immediate responses to changing conditions, enhancing system responsiveness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons of this approach:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Cons<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Python allows integration of diverse data sources beyond Tableau&#8217;s native capabilities.<\/td><td>Costly initial setup &#8211; A Python developer is needed to create the process and define alert conditions.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alerts can be highly customized, allowing deeper insight into potential problems.<\/td><td>Data connections must be custom-built for Python to access relevant information.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Messages can be delivered through various mediums, including Email, Slack, Telegram, or other messaging platforms.<\/td><td>The development team must provision resources for the process.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Machine learning and AI can be easily integrated into this process &#8211; enabling automated problem-correction processes<\/td><td>A highly technical implementation that can not be modified easily by standard business users.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How We Handled This Situation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After thoroughly assessing the situation, Tableau alerts were determined to be the best option. The main reason for this decision was the ability to implement this solution quickly with minimal business disruption. Another reason is that this client already used Tableau for other purposes, so no additional subscription cost was incurred for implementing these alerts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of this solution is that we could implement alerts within a few days, compared to 1-2 weeks for building out a custom process in Python. The solution did not require any resources from the development team, freeing up time to focus on other pressing issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was an immediate impact on data quality from these alerts. Business leaders gained more visibility into the system, identified issues in real-time, and alleviated common pain points that were dragging down the team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to use one tool over another always has pros and cons &#8211; and it is crucial to fully understand these tradeoffs before beginning any work. Our client decided it was better to sacrifice some flexibility with the alerting features to avoid any unnecessary overhead for the development team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, a lightweight and simple solution is the best bet, even if it\u2019s not exactly what business leaders desire. By building a simple solution efficiently, your team can receive the immediate gains that come with incremental improvements &#8211; rather than taking on this risk of sinking time and resources into a highly technical solution that becomes a burden to the team instead of helping to improve operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Partner with Databender<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with Databender can be a transformative experience.

with little knowledge about the underlying technology.<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\">Business leaders typically lack knowledge of AI and its potential benefits, which can create confusion and hinder effective decision-making. Additionally, the abundance of new tools in the market can overwhelm businesses, making it difficult for them to identify the most suitable solution for their needs. Navigating the complex AI landscape can be daunting, and having a clear understanding of the available tools is crucial for successful integration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\">Another challenge businesses often encounter is the need for more customization in AI tools. Off-the-shelf solutions may not always cater to individual organizations&#8217; unique needs and requirements. Furthermore, businesses may find it challenging to maintain and utilize their proprietary data for AI models, limiting the potential benefits of AI implementation. To harness the full power of AI, companies need to seek tailor-made solutions that seamlessly integrate with their existing systems and data, ensuring that the AI tools developed are fully customized and optimized for their specific business goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\">A critical concern for businesses adopting AI technology is the lack of explainability when issues occur. AI models can sometimes be seen as &#8220;black boxes,&#8221; making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions and predictions. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes scenarios. To overcome this challenge, organizations need to prioritize the development of AI systems that are not only effective but also explainable. Focusing on solutions that provide clear insights into the decision-making process can foster trust and confidence, enabling businesses to leverage the potential of AI technology fully.<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-33 elementor-top-column elementor-element

Home prices surged as more people looked to capitalize on the low cost of mortgages. Sellers were juggling multiple offers, with many receiving all-cash offers from investors well above the asking price.<\/p>\n<p>As we moved into 2022, the Federal Reserve attempted to tamper inflation by increasing interest rates multiple times. Over the year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/newsletters\/archive\/2022\/11\/us-real-estate-housing-market-shortage\/671988\/\">mortgage rates went from \u201call-time lows to all-century highs\u201d<\/a>, raising the cost of mortgage payments by around 50%.

According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/us\/us-existing-home-sales-fall-10th-straight-month-november-2022-12-21\/\">Reuters<\/a>, the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be one of the most substantial factors contributing to the decline in home sales. The Fed has been raising its benchmark interest rate at a blistering pace to combat high inflation. Inflation, as a result, has begun to retreat from the June 2022 peak of 9%. However, the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation continues, creating uncertainty for investors.<\/p>\n<p>Why do interest rates matter? Rates affect the cost of borrowing and the return on savings and investments. For real estate, rate increases lead to higher monthly payments for new buyers and drag down demand.<\/p>\n<p>Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between rates and monthly payments for a median U.S. home:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"584\" src=\"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1-1-1-1024x584.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7142\" srcset=\"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1-1-1-1024x584.png 1024w, https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1-1-1-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1-1-1-768x438.png 768w, https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1-1-1-1536x877.png 1536w, https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1-1-1-2048x1169.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong>Figure 1<\/strong>: Home price = $388K; Down payment = 20%; Loan term = 30Y fixed rate mortgage<br \/>*Does not consider taxes or fees<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A rate increase of 3-4 percentage points may seem insignificant, but regarding the monthly payment, a home buyer will pay 35% more at current rates than they would have in January 2022 for a home of equal value.

Lucrative television contracts and sponsorships bring in an excess of money for universities to spend on luxurious athletic facilities, stadium renovations, and increased salaries for the coaching staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f83f\">The NCAA football program is a profit-generating powerhouse. Yet, it still clings to a principle of amateurism \u2014 meaning it is a competition for athletes who \u201chave not profited above his\/her actual and necessary expenses or gained a competitive advantage in his\/her sport.\u201d However, as more money is poured into college sports, this principle has become a topic of fierce debate. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/college-athlete-pay-ncaa-employees-11658502884?mod=djemfoe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cMoney flowed to practically everyone except the athletes on the field.\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*FGu0NdwcA22CWpi5czeTCg.gif\" alt=\"Image retrieved from https:\/\/gifer.com\/en\/SVdL\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A recent South Park episode about the NCAA and its relationship with student-athletes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p id=\"4fd4\">In June of 2021, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that strict limits on compensating college athletes violate U.S. antitrust law. This ruling allowed schools to offer compensation beyond the cost of attending college and opened the door for states to permit athletes to earn money from their name, image, and likeness. Student-athletes and the NCAA are now in uncharted territory, riding the wave of the athletes\u2019 rights movement into a growing push for employment, where athletes share in the revenues generated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d7dc\">In September of 2022, the College Football Playoffs were expanded from four teams to twelve. The target year for this expansion is 2026, but the sport\u2019s commissioners are pushing to implement it as soon as 2024. This decision is primarily driven by the massive paydays from television and media rights.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/09\/02\/sports\/ncaafootball\/college-football-playoff-expansion.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Some have forecasted that the expanded playoffs would be the largest annual television rights deal in college sports, at nearly $2 billion per year.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0dfd\">Only time will tell what happens to the NCAA, the College Football Playoffs, and student-athlete compensation. Still, in the meantime, there is a lingering question: If student-athletes are not allowed to be paid, but the amount of money being made from broadcast rights is increasing substantially, where is all the money going?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cdf5\">It\u2019s not hard to understand why there is a growing movement toward the employment of student-athletes. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the numbers from&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/knightnewhousedata.org\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">knightnewhousedata.org<\/a>&nbsp;for the Big Ten Conference over the past ten years (excluding 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The average amount of Total Revenue generated by each college increased 57% (from $89M to $139.3M)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average Athletic Student Aid increased 61% (from $10.5M to $16.9M)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The share of money coming in from NCAA\/Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Games&nbsp;<strong>increased a whopping 211%<\/strong> (from $232.1M to $722.3M)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*fGSEw_rnyFCTHh99Jiyo8Q.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"318c\">  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"318c\">So, student aid has kept pace with the increased revenues?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9613\">Well, not exactly.

The share of the money that goes to coaches and support staff has increased substantially, which leaves a smaller percentage of the pie for everything else. This trend occurs across all conferences, regardless of size or overall revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f534\">Let\u2019s take a broader view of all NCAA conferences. The most noticeable trend is the difference in the percentage of expenses that go toward student aid between smaller and larger conferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*IH0eYkBbs0VwgQD2RT1S6A.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cd7d\">This difference in the share of student aid expenses reflects the current reality of college football. The Mid-American Conference generated $407.2M in revenue for 2020; the Southeastern Conference generated more than four times that amount at a staggering $1.9B. The difference in Media Rights revenue can explain this gap: the Mid-American Conference made $33.3M in 2020,&nbsp;<strong>less than 5% of what the Southeastern Conference made<\/strong>&nbsp;($711.8M).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7f4e\">Lately, there has been a trend of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/usc-ucla-big-ten-11656623463?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">well-known schools moving to ever-richer athletic conferences<\/a>. This is driven mainly by the massive increases in media and broadcast rights for football games. With the addition of the College Football Playoff, this trend has only accelerated. Everyone seems to be chasing the money, but the core producers of the product (student-athletes) are left behind under the guise of \u201camateurism.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1a99\">In July 2022, USC and UCLA announced they plan to switch conferences, migrating from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten. This is one of the latest moves driven by money \u2014 where schools are switching to richer conferences in pursuit of ever-increasing payouts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"667d\">In 2020:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The University of South Carolina made $133M in Total Revenue<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The University of South Carolina spent $15.1M on Student Aid<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are 100 players on the active roster, so the average Student Aid per player is roughly $151,000 per player<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Athletic Student Aid was equal to&nbsp;<strong>11% of Total Revenue<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The University of South Carolina\u2019s head coach&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/sports\/usc\/story\/2021-05-17\/usc-coach-clay-helton-4-8-million-salary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">made $4.8M<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Coaches\u2019 Compensation and Admin Compensation were equal to&nbsp;<strong>40% of Total Revenue<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"877c\">Based on these numbers, the average player receives roughly 3% of what the head coach makes. There are plenty of arguments for why the head coach should make more money than the players, but let\u2019s avoid those for now and stick with the numbers. The players, who produce most of the product and risk personal injury, receive good compensation compared to an average job. However, none of the money they receive can be used for anything except overpriced tuition, room &amp; board, and textbooks. So, in reality, a majority of this money never leaves the university.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c1d0\">In conclusion, the NCAA and college football are going through a wild period of transformation. Lots of money is flowing into the industry, but the main producers of the product don\u2019t see any benefit from this. It appears that most of the money is being funneled to the top, with coaching &amp; admin staff reaping most of the rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ef48\">Curious to see how a specific college or conference compares to others?

Competition can be fierce, and the punishment for losing can be humiliating. Last year, the loser of our league had to wear a clown costume during the Super Bowl party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to avoid such a terrible punishment (and maybe win a few bucks), we\u2019re going to look at some advanced approaches for draft strategies. The primary metric we\u2019ll focus on is VOR (value over replacement), which measures the value a player provides compared to an average player at that position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few other metrics we\u2019ll include in our draft strategy, including Expert Consensus Rating, Average Draft Position, and Risk. These concepts can be tricky, so our team built an application anyone can use while drafting. Feel free to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.powerbi.com\/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjQ5NmQ5YWYtNThkZC00YTQwLTkyMzUtMTFhZDE3ZmIyODBjIiwidCI6ImE0ZDAzODUwLTI5Y2MtNDk5MC04NTc5LTc5NTdmZmM4OTUyYyIsImMiOjZ9\">head directly to the app<\/a> or continue reading to learn more about the metrics used, our methodology for calculating these metrics, and how to use this tool during your draft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to find maximum value in your draft<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a snake draft, every team can select one player per round. The order reverses every round, so the team to pick last in one round will pick first in the following round. The pool of players gets smaller with each round, and a team manager must determine which player provides the best value compared to the remaining pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to approach a draft like this is to think of players like stocks. The goal is to pick players that others undervalue and maximize potential upside for bench players while minimizing risk for starters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1600\/1*hgObKGXSPetLJDcPXgfSsQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill using \u201csabermetrics\u201d in Moneyball<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To accurately determine a player\u2019s value, we need to compare their projected points to the average player at the same position. There are many ways to determine what an average player is, but for our purposes, we will define an average player as \u201cthe player whose position rank is equal to the number of players at that position who are taken (on average) by pick 100\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we\u2019ve calculated the average player\u2019s value by position, we can compare each player\u2019s value to the average to calculate VOR. You can find a more detailed explanation of the VOR calculation and all other metrics used in the app in the documentation for the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FantasyFootballAnalytics\/ffanalytics\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ffanalytics R package<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VOR highlights the problem of focusing only on projected points when drafting. When looking at projected points, it is easy to think that a quarterback is the most valuable player. Out of the top ten projected scorers for 2022, seven are quarterbacks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Josh Allen<\/strong> (QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a374.8<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Patrick Mahomes<\/strong> (QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a351.4<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Justin Herbert<\/strong> (QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a327.6<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jalen Hurts<\/strong> (QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a320.6<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dak Prescott <\/strong>(QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a316.7<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lamar Jackson<\/strong> (QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a315.2<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jonathan Taylor (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a314.7<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kyler Murray<\/strong> (QB)\u200a\u2014\u200a313.6<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cooper Kupp (WR)\u200a\u2014\u200a310.9<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Christian McCaffrey (WR)\u200a\u2014\u200a310.4<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when we look at the VOR rankings, there are no quarterbacks in the top ten:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Jonathan Taylor (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a175.6<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cooper Kupp (WR)\u200a\u2014\u200a173.0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Christian McCaffrey (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a165.9<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Austin Ekeler (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a165.0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Travis Kelce (TE)\u200a\u2014\u200a140.2<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Derrick Henry (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a133.6<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Justin Jefferson (WR)\u200a\u2014\u200a125.9<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mark Andrews (TE)\u200a\u2014\u200a118.5<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Najee Harris (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a116.0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dalvin Cook (RB)\u200a\u2014\u200a115.9<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No quarterbacks are in the top ten by VOR because there are many high-scoring quarterbacks just below the top tier. It is easy to find a replacement for this position that can score close to the same points as the top performers. This is different for other positions, with top-tier running backs and receivers having a much larger value than the typical replacement player at each position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The main point to understand here is that points rankings overvalue quarterbacks.<\/strong> Focusing on more relevant metrics like VOR helps a team manager choose players that provide the most value to their fantasy team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many other factors to consider when drafting, but I\u2019ll spare the details for another time.

It\u2019s important to be aware of how your data is collected, who can see it, and what others can do with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"68f2\"><strong>Data science is more than just understanding programming and statistics \u2014 it\u2019s about understanding the systems surrounding our daily lives.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f5a0\">The most critical areas of data science to understand are data collection, data warehousing, modeling, and use cases for machine learning. Learning these concepts can help you discover the data you are generating, how others use your data, and how you can leverage data science for your business and\/or personal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"176d\"><strong>Data collection<\/strong>\u00a0happens constantly, especially in today\u2019s digital age. Knowing what information is collected and why it is collected is essential \u2014 from both a user and a business perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bf76\">If you\u2019re running an online business, your storefront is your website. It is crucial to know how users interact with your site, which pages are being interacted with the most, what referral channels lead to site visits, and how many visitors leave the site without any action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cba2\">Businesses measure the interactions with their websites very closely to optimize the customer\u2019s experience. Many companies run experiments with slightly different site layouts to further optimize the customer\u2019s experience, a concept called A\/B testing. These experiments are constantly running on a vast scale, allowing businesses to continuously tweak their site layouts to maximize their end goal \u2014 whether that be increased interaction, sales, or some other target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8d27\">There are many other areas where data is generated in the business process. These areas include production systems, HR systems, transactional databases, and more. Being aware of what data is being generated by your business (or yourself) and how to best leverage it is the first step to learning data science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Warehousing<\/strong>\u00a0is the backbone of all data analysis. Generally speaking, this is a central repository of information that is generated within a company. This information comes from many sources like transaction systems, marketing software, surveys, or external vendors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"823d\">Building an effective data warehouse can be a huge undertaking, mainly because data must be collected from disparate areas of the business and integrated into a standardized format. Work must be done with multiple stakeholders to ensure all data is extracted correctly, transformed, and loaded from source systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"503a\"><a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/data-warehouse\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to AWS<\/a>, some of the main benefits of using a data warehouse are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><em>Informed decision making<\/em><\/li><li><em>Consolidated data from many sources<\/em><\/li><li><em>Historical data analysis<\/em><\/li><li><em>Data quality, consistency, and accuracy<\/em><\/li><li><em>Separation of analytics processing from transactional databases, improving the performance of both systems<\/em><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f625\">Typically, this step is the most time-consuming data science process. As a result, many SaaS offerings have come about lately to help alleviate this bottleneck. Nowadays, there are tools that enable business analysts to complete the integration work that could previously only be handled by a skilled data engineer. This helps open the door for many smaller companies or individuals to work with their data and gather insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"386f\"><strong>Modeling\u00a0<\/strong>is one of the most important pieces of data science. At a high level, a model is a mathematical representation used to explain reality. Models are used to explain and predict company sales, forest fires, weather events, and even for recommending movies on Netflix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f866\">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are built upon these models, using available data to predict a future outcome. The model used can vary widely based on each specific use case, so I\u2019ll avoid going into specifics. To put it briefly, some models are easier to explain, and some can not be explained easily but have a high prediction power. Some situations require explainability (medical diagnoses, regulatory compliance, etc.), and others are more concerned with accuracy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2e23\">The main takeaway here is that models are complex mathematic formulas used to represent reality and predict future outcomes. Being able to leverage their predictive power for your business or your personal pursuits is key to learning data science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e9b4\">Oxford defines<strong>\u00a0machine learning<\/strong>\u00a0as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cthe use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data\u201d.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cee6\">In simple terms \u2014 machine learning uses a model (or models) to predict future outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9875\">One of the most common applications of machine learning is Natural Language Processing (NLP). If you\u2019re aware of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2020\/07\/20\/1005454\/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GPT-3 model<\/a>, then you know just how powerful machine learning can be. This model can produce incredibly realistic articles; at times, its writing is indistinguishable from a human\u2019s writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"aedd\">Another common application of machine learning is for recommendations and advertisements. When Facebook or LinkedIn recommend \u2018People you may know\u2019, they leverage machine learning to find associations between your profile and similar profiles. When Netflix recommends what movie or TV show to watch next, it predicts what you\u2019ll watch based on what you\u2019ve watched in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fad9\">Personalized marketing is one of the most powerful applications of machine learning for a business. Customers can be segmented based on shopping patterns, site interactions, or by some other means. The machine learning model identifies which segment a customer falls in and allows a business to send targeted, personal ads to customers. Being knowledgeable of the potential use cases for machine learning \u2014 and where it can be used in your digital strategy is the final key to learning data science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"767f\">In conclusion \u2014 anyone can learn the basics of data science. These powerful tools can be used to build a business, improve one\u2019s personal life, or simply to better understand the world around us. Knowing what is currently being done with data and what data can do for you is key to success in our rapidly evolving world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"547d\">Thanks for reading!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b995\">Below are some of the educational resources I\u2019ve found most helpful if you\u2019d like to dig deeper into data science:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python\/dp\/1492041130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Data Science from Scratch \u2014 First Principles with Python by Joel Grus<\/a><\/li><li>If you\u2019re willing to subscribe to Medium, they have a bunch of excellent technical articles, and I read a lot here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/medium.com\/towards-data-science&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1609360894743000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHt54196QqLlNX6pxyrPiKW5rtsaA\">https:\/\/www.medium.com\/towards-data-science<\/a><\/li><li>These guys are free, and they have some interesting articles:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1609360894743000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTMV296rzvG5fD0n68wgnlx720Lg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.analyticsvidhya.com\/<\/a><\/li><li>Youtube can also be a great source for free learning materials<\/li><li>Datacamp, Coursera, and EdX are all good paid options \u2014 I\u2019m personally taking a few Micromasters courses from MIT on EdX<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f52b\"><em>If you want to learn more about data management, advanced analytics, or just have a general interest in data\u200a\u2014\u200agive us a follow on <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/databender\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>LinkedIn<\/em><\/a><em> and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/databenderconsulting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Facebook<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Data science is more than just understanding programming and statistics \u2014 it\u2019s about understanding the systems surrounding our daily lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3915,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3913","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-data"],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3913","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3913"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3913\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3921,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3913\/revisions\/3921"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3915"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3913"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3913"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/databender.co\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3913"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":3813,"date":"2022-07-27T22:16:12","date_gmt":"2022-07-27T22:16:12","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/databender.co\/?p=3813"},"modified":"2023-05-03T02:45:43","modified_gmt":"2023-05-03T02:45:43","slug":"our-story-purpose-in-this-digital-world","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/databender.co\/about-us\/our-story-purpose-in-this-digital-world\/","title":{"rendered":"Our story &#038; purpose"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><em>A note from our founder<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"73c3\">Technology has always fascinated me.

very interesting topic over the past few years. Many investors have been burned by the recent downturn (myself included) &#8211; but as international tensions rise and inflation continues to soar, the promise of crypto has never looked better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As this young industry continues to grow, there are natural inefficiencies that arise in the market. For example, different exchanges will get out of sync with each other from time to time, which causes a variation in price between exchanges. This variance can be exploited for profit, but traders must move quickly to capture the opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, we worked with a crypto trading firm to build a solution for this exact use case. The goal was to design and implement a real-time data stream with the ability to feed data into an automated trading bot about market opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Case Study<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>See below for a case study that summarizes our implementation of a data streaming &amp; trading bot solution for cryptocurrency arbitrage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goal<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a cloud environment that can support 100+ web scrapers at a time, aggregate and compare data in real-time from several data sources, implement an API for the trading bots, and enable autoscaling to handle high-volume periods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Current Issues<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous attempts to build a real-time data feed were unsuccessful because there was too much latency between the data feed and trading bots. Data was unreliable, there were many false positives, and trading bots ended up missing opportunities becuase of the system latency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this project, our team recommended: Kubernetes for its autoscaling capabilities, Redis for in-memory data storage, and Python for data collection and the decision engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/uIlyv9HWZ9-5mozNGjFSe1f4YSND7W1Hdqc3yXyXhPLPlHnkKPc65YRDBtrRdd84HICl-icDb7NO1AdS44sKZ-xEPq117oYzN_DJVdCV7Kj9Nts4Dtz2KpNdn_7Y2x_kB647Wm3SppoABj4tPZA77zs_olyPAmfJbPLAVn6jYze1GWo3tKBDRFYv\" width=\"624\" height=\"156\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our solution enabled anyone in the organization to have access to \u201clive\u201d data within a moment\u2019s notice. Markets with different naming conventions were merged together using a matching engine, and historical archives were able to capture a treasure trove of information for predictive use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the largest benefits from this solution: market conditions were fed into trading bots every half second, enabling rapid decisions to be made by our arbitrage model. By leveraging the power of high-quality, rapid data ingestion &#8211; this implementation enabled a trading bot to operate and learn at a much faster pace than any manual trader.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the proper tools needed for this use case allowed this client to achieve levels of efficiency with their data that were previously unattainable.&nbsp;Trading bot profitability increased around 63%, and overall efficiency improved dramatically (efficiency in terms of profitable trades).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious about data streaming applications or financial bots?

Not to mention all the report formatting must be the same, the reports must be polished and clean, and it all needs to be reproducible in case someone challenges the numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, this would require lots of manual work to create these reports. Data must be collected, stored, analyzed, and presented in a compelling fashion. Analysts must spend hours creating pivot tables, copy\/pasting charts, and aligning the text in slides. Then, someone has a question about how a specific metric was calculated &#8211; but the Excel file used to create it is missing. Nobody knows how that number was reached, so the entire calculation needs to be redone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thanks to the power of RStudio and Markdown, there&#8217;s a better way to go about all this.&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>R Markdown is a powerful tool that combines R and Python with Markdown (a language for creating formatted text documents). You can write scripts using your preferred language to produce high-quality, custom reports. The output can be various file types: Powerpoint slides, Word documents, PDFs, HTML files, and even websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many benefits to converting any manual reporting process to an automated script:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Reproducibility of calculations &#8211; every step taken to reach a calculation is documented in the script, so it is easy to trace back any errors or reproduce findings<\/li><li>Styles and chart formatting can be shared for all reports &#8211; remove the need to align formatting between different reporting areas<\/li><li>A large number of different reports can be produced en-masse &#8211; parameterized reporting allows reports to change data sources, adjust periods, or mass produce various reports<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Study<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>See below for a case study on a Markdown solution we implemented, followed by a summary of this project&#8217;s main takeaways and benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goal<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create an end-to-end solution to produce parameterized reports from Qualtrics survey data using Azure, R, and NVivo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Current Reporting Issues<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating highly customized reports can be a painstaking manual process. Analysts spend hours copying and pasting screenshots of pivot tables, charts, and ad-hoc analyses. Then all the items need to be formatted and aligned correctly, a thankless task necessary for producing high-quality reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant issues with report production is the reproducibility of specific calculations when numbers are questioned. Confirming a calculation can be difficult if the data was updated or changed. Any requested change needs to be manually applied to each file, which can be troublesome if the reports have already been produced. Tracing through endless spreadsheets until the correct chart is found can significantly drain efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specific Needs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case study, a global analytics team was interested in implementing a reporting solution that was fully automated and highly customized. Reports needed to be generated for specific areas of the organization, which were then distributed to leadership and other relevant stakeholders. Survey data needed to be loaded from Qualtrics, enriched with internal employee data, and displayed in an anonymized format.

Marketo was unable to communicate with other CRM systems to understand what communications and interactions each customer was having. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there was no communication between systems, automated marketing emails were poorly timed.
