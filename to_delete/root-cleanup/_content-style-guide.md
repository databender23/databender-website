# Databender Content Style Guide

*Avoiding AI-generated giveaways across all marketing content.*

*Last updated: 2026-01-11*

## Purpose

This guide ensures all Databender content (website, blog, LinkedIn, proposals, emails) reads as authentically human. AI-assisted drafting is fine. AI-sounding output is not.

The goal: content that passes both AI detectors and (more importantly) the human "smell test."

## How AI Detection Works (Why This Matters)

Understanding detection helps you avoid triggers. AI detectors measure two things:

**Perplexity**: How "surprising" your word choices are. AI text scores low perplexity because it chooses statistically "safe" words. Human writing has higher perplexity from unexpected word choices, idioms, and creative flourishes. Text with perplexity below 85 gets flagged.

**Burstiness**: How much variation exists across the document. Human writing has characteristic "bursts" (clusters of short punchy sentences followed by longer complex ones). AI produces uniform sentence distributions, typically clustering at 15-25 words with consistent structure throughout.

**The core detection signal is predictability.** AI fails because it's too consistent: uniform sentence lengths, predictable word choices, formulaic organization.

## Voice Principles

### Company Voice
- Professional but with personality
- Direct and confident, not hedging
- Skeptical of hype, grounded in reality
- Punchy over polished
- Specific over generic

### What Makes Us Sound Like Us
- "We're skeptics by nature"
- Strong opinions stated plainly
- Memorable metaphors ("buying lottery tickets," "data problem wearing a sales costume")
- Concrete examples over abstract claims
- Humor where it fits (dry, not forced)

---

## Hard Rules

### Never Use
| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| First-person singular ("I", "I've", "my", "me") | Company voice only. Use "we" instead. |
| Em dashes (—) | AI tell (GPT-4 overuses these). Use periods, commas, or parentheses. |
| Double hyphens (--) | Same rule. |

### AI Slop Words (Complete Ban List)

These words trigger detection and scream "AI wrote this":

**Priority 1 - Highest Detection Signal (Never Use):**
```
delve, leverage, robust, seamless, furthermore, moreover, utilize,
comprehensive, pivotal, crucial, subsequently, consequently, facilitate,
holistic, scalable, actionable, impactful, transformative, paradigm,
empower, innovative, synergy, optimal, henceforth, notwithstanding
```

**Priority 2 - High Detection Signal (Avoid):**
```
enhance, ensure, implement, significant, demonstrate, additionally,
therefore, indeed, notably, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, state-of-the-art,
game-changer, next-generation, unlock, unleash, harness, elevate,
spearhead, embark, multifaceted, meticulous, intricate, nuanced
```

**Priority 3 - Moderate Signal (Use Sparingly):**
```
effectively, efficiently, significantly, specifically, essentially,
ultimately, remarkable, dynamic, vibrant, bustling, ever-evolving
```

**Word Substitutions:**
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| utilize | use |
| leverage | use, apply |
| facilitate | help, enable, let |
| comprehensive | full, complete, thorough |
| subsequently | then, later, after |
| consequently | so, as a result |
| implement | put in place, use, do |
| enhance | improve, boost |
| ensure | make sure, confirm |
| significant | large, major, important |
| demonstrate | show, prove |
| optimal | best, ideal |
| commence | start, begin |
| endeavor | try, attempt |
| pivotal | key, important |
| crucial | important, key, vital |
| underscore | emphasize, highlight |

**Vague Formal Terms:**
framework, ecosystem, stakeholders, deliverables, circle back, move the needle, low-hanging fruit, touch base, synergize

### Filler Phrases (Delete on Sight)

**Opening Phrases:**
- "It's important to note that..."
- "It's worth mentioning..."
- "It should be noted..."
- "It is essential to understand..."
- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..."
- "In the dynamic world of..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."

- "At the end of the day..."
- "This begs the question..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "There are many ways to..."
- "One could argue that..."

**Transition Fillers:**
- "Needless to say..."
- "Be that as it may..."
- "Bearing in mind..."
- "One must consider..."

**Vague Closers:**
- "A gateway to..."
- "Paving the way for..."
- "Bridging the gap..."
- "Push the boundaries..."
- "The possibilities are endless"
- "Make informed decisions"

## AI Detection Patterns to Avoid

AI text gets flagged for being too predictable and uniform. Avoid these patterns:

### Sentence Length Uniformity (Strongest Tell)

**Problem:** AI generates sentences clustering in the 10-30 word range with low variation. This is the single strongest structural tell.

**Target Distribution:**
- ~20% short sentences (≤10 words)
- ~60% medium sentences (11-25 words)
- ~20% long sentences (26+ words)

**Fix:** Create "bursts" - clusters of short sentences followed by longer ones. Never have 3+ consecutive sentences of similar length (within ±5 words).

**Before:** "The data was incomplete. The model performed poorly. The team lacked context. The project failed." (All ~5 words)

**After:** "The data was incomplete. That single gap cascaded through everything: the model performed poorly, the team operated without context, and six months of work collapsed in a week."

### Overused Transitions

**Problem:** AI connects every sentence with formal transitions.

**Avoid:** furthermore, however, in addition, as a result, moreover, consequently, therefore, thus, hence, additionally, indeed, notably

**Fix:** Let sentences stand alone. Implicit connections are fine. Use transitions sparingly.

**Before:** "The data was incomplete. As a result, the model performed poorly. Furthermore, the team lacked context."

**After:** "The data was incomplete. The model performed poorly. The team lacked context."

### Sentence Opener Repetition

**Problem:** AI uses the same sentence structure repeatedly.

**Common AI openers to vary:**
- "This..." (This approach, This method, This allows)
- "It is..." (It is important, It is worth noting)
- "There are..." constructions
- "-ing" participle phrases starting sentences
- Transition word openers

**Fix:** No more than 2-3 consecutive sentences should begin with the same structure. Vary with:
- Direct subject openers
- Prepositional phrases
- Questions
- Dependent clauses
- Time/place markers

### Cliché Openings

**Problem:** AI uses generic, templated introductions.

**Avoid:**
- "In the dynamic world of [topic]..."
- "When it comes to [topic]..."
- "In today's fast-paced environment..."
- "In recent years..."

**Fix:** Start with a specific hook, stat, or provocative statement.

**Before:** "In today's competitive business landscape, data is more important than ever."

**After:** "Eighty-seven percent of AI projects never make it to production."

### Formulaic Closings

**Problem:** AI wraps up too neatly.

**Avoid:**
- "In summary,"
- "In conclusion,"
- "To summarize,"
- "Overall," as a paragraph starter

**Fix:** End with a punch, a call to action, or a memorable line. Don't announce the ending.

### Hedging Language

**Problem:** AI is too polite and non-committal.

**Avoid:**
- "It's understandable that..."
- "Ultimately,..."
- "To be sure,..."
- "It could be argued that..."
- "In many cases,..."
- "It depends on..."
- "Can vary depending on..."
- "You may want to..."
- "It is advisable..."
- "Generally considered..."

**Fix:** State opinions directly. Take a stance.

**Before:** "It could be argued that most companies aren't ready for AI."

**After:** "Most companies aren't ready for AI."

### Redundancy Phrases

**Problem:** AI restates the same idea multiple ways to fill space.

**Avoid:**
- "In other words,..."
- "This means that..."
- "Put simply,..."
- "What this essentially means is..."

**Fix:** State the point once, clearly. Trust the reader.

### Negative Parallelism (Rule of Three)

**Problem:** AI overuses balanced contrasts and tripartite structures.

**Avoid overusing:**
- "It's not just X, it's Y"
- "Not only A but also B"
- "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- Lists of exactly three items
- "adjective, adjective, and adjective" patterns

**Fix:** Use pairs, singles, or fours instead. Break symmetrical structures. One negative parallelism per piece max.

### Structural Uniformity

**Problem:** AI creates symmetrical, templated content.

**Signs:**
- Every paragraph same length (AI clusters at 100-150 words)
- Every section covers exactly 3 points
- Every bullet point same structure
- Perfectly balanced sections

**Fix:** Vary deliberately. No two consecutive paragraphs within ±20% word count. Linger on important ideas, rush through obvious ones.

### Passive Voice Overuse

**Problem:** AI uses passive voice 30-40%+ of the time to avoid naming agents.

**Before:** "The analysis was conducted and the results were reviewed."

**After:** "Our team analyzed the data and reviewed the results."

**Fix:** Convert passive to active. Name specific actors. "was implemented" becomes "we implemented" or "Smith's team implemented."

### Tone Flatness

**Problem:** AI maintains one register throughout (usually polite, neutral).

**Signs:**
- No emotional variation
- Constant formality
- No emphasis or opinion

**Fix:** Let tone shift naturally. Show excitement about wins. Show skepticism about hype. Use emphasis.

## Humanization Techniques

Apply these to make content feel authentic:

### Vary Rhythm (Burstiness)

Target deliberate variation in sentence length:
- Mix short punchy (≤10 words) with medium (11-25) and long (26+)
- Create "bursts" - clusters of short sentences, then longer ones
- Fragment for emphasis. Like this.
- Break the "smooth" AI cadence

**Burstiness Check:** If you have 3+ consecutive sentences of similar length, restructure.

### Add Texture (Specificity)

AI produces generic, abstract text. Counter with:
- Concrete examples over abstract statements
- Specific numbers ("34% increase" not "significant improvement")
- Named examples ("like Snowflake's approach" not "leading companies")
- Specific timeframes ("Q3 2025" not "in recent years")
- Mini-anecdotes or scenarios
- Colloquial phrases where appropriate ("sweaty palms and all")

**Specificity injection points:** Replace vague references with concrete details.

### Show Opinion (Stance Markers)

AI produces balanced, hedged text. Counter with:
- Clear evaluative statements ("This approach works better")
- Take a stance, don't hedge everything
- Use emphatic language ("frankly," "surprisingly," "the uncomfortable truth")
- Rhetorical questions ("Do you know which leads will close?")
- Mild skepticism where it fits
- Decisive language replacing hedging

### Break Symmetry

- Some paragraphs longer than others
- Some points explored deeply, others briefly
- Don't give equal weight to everything
- Maximum one bulleted list per 1000 words
- Lists should have 2, 4, or 5+ items (avoid rule-of-three)
- "Humans linger on ideas they care about and rush through obvious ones"

### Natural Imperfections (Controlled)

Human writing contains characteristic irregularities:
- Start occasional sentences with "And" or "But"
- Use contractions ("don't" not "do not", "it's" not "it is")
- Rhetorical questions
- Direct address to reader ("you," "your")
- One-word sentences for emphasis ("Really.")
- Parenthetical asides
- Sentence fragments where effective

## First-Person Alternatives

When tempted to use "I," try these instead:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "I think..." | State directly, or "You might be thinking..." |
| "I've seen..." | "We've seen..." |
| "Let me explain..." | "Let's look at..." or just explain |
| "I believe..." | State as opinion directly |
| "What drives me crazy..." | "Here's what's maddening..." |
| "I'm supposed to..." | "People expect..." |

## Examples

### Before (AI-sounding)
"In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, it's important to note that data has become a critical asset. Furthermore, organizations that leverage their data effectively can achieve transformative results. As a result, many companies are exploring AI solutions. However, it's understandable that some may feel hesitant about this transition."

**Problems:** Cliché opener, filler phrase, AI slop words (leverage, transformative), overused transitions (furthermore, as a result, however), hedging language, uniform sentence length.

### After (Human)
"Most companies are sitting on years of data they've never looked at. The ones who figure out how to use it pull ahead. The ones who don't keep wondering why their competitors seem to know things they don't."

**Fixes:** Specific claim, varied sentence lengths, no transitions needed, confident stance, punchy rhythm.

## Validation

For important content, run Claude validation:

"Scan this content for AI tells: first-person (I, my, me), em dashes, AI slop words (delve, leverage, synergy, etc.), overused transitions, hedging language, redundancy phrases, structural uniformity, sentence length uniformity, and filler phrases. Flag any violations and check burstiness."
